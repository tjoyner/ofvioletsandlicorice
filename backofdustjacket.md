*Daniel looked at the glass: another important wine. From its color, Daniel thought it must also be Nebbiolo. It was still garnet red, with the sparkle of a sunset, when the sun, the color of an orange, goes to die between one hill and the next, as if it were dancing the tango with a gay melancholy.*

It is the fragrance of wine and the earth, above all, that tell us this is a story of the Langhe. Then it is the shyness of a proud and fragile woman, the curves of the hills, a gambling debt, a duel to the last glass...

In this delicate and poignant story, made of lonely encounters and flavors that come from far away, Nico Orengo's light and lively pen succeeds in telling a story about the wounds of life that impact the mind and the surroundings, echoes of the past bouncing on an unknown future, the difficult art of not getting lost completely.
