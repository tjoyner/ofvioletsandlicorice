*Daniel looked at the glass: another prominent wine. From its color, Daniel thought it also came from Nebbiolo, the color was again garnet red with sparkles of sunset, when the sun, the color of a squeezed orange, goes to die between one hill and the next, as if it were dancing the tango with a gay melancholy.*

It is the aromas of wine and the earth, first of all, that tell us this is a story of the Langhe. Then it's the moodiness of a proud and fragile woman, the curves of the hills, a gambling debt, a duel to the last glass...

In this delicate and poignant story, made of lonely encounters and distant flavors, Nico Orengo's light and lively pen succeeds in telling a story about the wounds of life that impact minds and places, echoes of the past that bounce on an unknown future, the difficult art of not losing your way completely.
