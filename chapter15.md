"The gambling debts must be paid," the lawyer Gallo had said. "There are witnesses. There's a written document."

Amalia looked out the window at the old furniture of the house piling up in the courtyard, in a gesture that Baravalle had called 'generosity': iron beds, cabinets, chests, chairs. Half of Ginotta accumulated in disorder like a photo album blown by the wind. Amalia looked at the old furniture, and could no longer distinguish the memories, intertwined and confused in a feeling where the bitter prevailed over the sweet and nostalgia was an acid that burned.

She had told Daniel to bring Nicole and Maria to dinner, she'd also wanted them to see where Giulio's stupidity had taken Ginotta. 

Daniel remained perplexed. Nicole needed calm: he didn't want to drag her into a situation that would likely be tense. And when Amalia had said to invite them to dinner, he and the girls, he'd asked if they wouldn't prefer to eat out, maybe at that enoteca in Canale, where in Paris they said there was a young chef of great inventiveness. But Amalia was decisive: "You made her come, your daughter? So she could see a little bit of what happens in the world where her father works. [Stop using kid gloves](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#bambagia), look at me, who tried to relieve my brother of any responsibility. Fool that I am."

Daniel felt he couldn't fight back: Amalia had to absorb the blow and he couldn't expect that to happen in an instant, or that she could cast it aside. He said, "We'll pick up Giulio."

Amalia shrugged her shoulders: "If the coward feels like it... if you can get him out of bed, wherever he's staying..."

Daniel had asked Maria to let Nicole know what had happened between Giulio and Amalia, and of the card game that had condemned Ginotta, but then he reconsidered, and while she was sitting on the bed with Flop he tried to tell her about the relationship that bound Amalia and Giulio. Nicole was indifferent, and asked him, "Are you interested in Amalia?"

Daniel sat on the bed, and was petting Flop. 

"I've asked myself that also. Rather, I've asked myself how much..."

Nicole laughed, and asked "And what was your answer?"

Daniel shifted his hand from Flop's head to Nicole's shoulder. 

"This whole story doesn't help, it doesn't help give me a clear idea. Do you understand?"

"Yeah, it would be a lie to say that in times of difficulty you understand the genuineness of a feeling. Bullshit, in those moments it's easy for everyone to be an ass."

Daniel looked at her and she seemed more mature than he'd thought; he thought of how little he'd ever spoken to her, but also the discomfort he felt when talking to her. Or maybe not discomfort but just unease. He didn't have the education, the training, the capacity for it. When he'd separated with Laurencine and was no longer at home, he'd been unable to say anything to her. He'd gone to pick her up at the house to take her to a restaurant and, he remembered, he hadn't mentioned that he would no longer be living with them. He'd thought that the task of explaining the reasons for the split between Laurencine and him belonged to the ex-wife, if she hadn't already understood by herself. It was a mistake, and over the years he'd wanted to correct it, but he wasn't able to. He had a knot inside that prevented it, that came to him from afar, ever since, in his home, as a child, he had learned that we express our feelings with silence or with gestures. That's how it was with his grandparents, that's how it was between his parents. At the slightest hint of discussion his grandfather would slip off into the countryside; if his father sensed a possible conflict with his mother, Daniel saw him take his fishing rod and go out. With Laurencine he used the technique of solitaire; he took the cards and sat at the table combining the numbers and colors. For himself it had worked, or so it had always seemed to him. Between Laurencine and him, no. And also not between Nicole and him.

Daniel asked, awkwardly: "Do you like Maria?" and quickly added "You get along, as friends..." 

He wondered why he'd had to specify the feelings between the two girls. What was he afraid of? He shook his head and it reinforced the idea that [silence was the more sympathetic language regarding other people's emotions](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#comprensivo).

He said "What do you think of Giulio?" and immediately bit his tongue. 

Nicole didn't answer the question. She shrugged and pushed Flop off the bed. 

"Let me dress, Flop. Go outside and in a half hour we'll go get Maria. Maria's coming too, right? Amalia knows her..."

Daniel had agreed, the Japanese girl searching for Italian wines would be part of the company.

They'd gone to take Giulio back home. Daniel had compelled him to shave and put on clean clothes. He'd found him in bed, as Amalia had said, wearing what he'd had on when they met in Nice, two days before.

He'd resisted, he'd said that he didn't feel well. He finally admitted to not wanting to see Amalia. He didn't want to see that line of cement and plaster that divided Ginotta in two.

"Sooner or later it has to happen, [don't let too much time go by](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#troppotempo). Besides, at night you won't notice as much..." Daniel had said, regretting the stupid joke. 

And instead, that white line in the still clear evening and with a full moon seemed phosphorescent and bloody like a just-inflicted wound. They saw her just as they crossed the avenue of beech trees and arrived at the yard. She seemed to be digging up the ground and stripping the old stones from the farmhouse. And beyond that knife wound they saw the pile of furniture. Giulio suppressed a curse as the two girls turned to Daniel with a questioning look.

"Do you see that?" he asked them.

Amalia had been cleaning in the kitchen, rehanging the old branches along the walls, straightening the table in the middle of the room and the cupboards along the walls, she had emptied the baskets, dried kindling, and soda boxes from the large fireplace. 

They both nodded, not knowing whether the question about Amalia referred to the orderliness of the large room, or to the pile of old furniture in the yard.

The two girls asked if they could see the house and got lost in the dark hallway, Giulio and Daniel remained in the room; while Giulio sat on a bench fiddling with old plaster fruit, as if rediscovering a game of times past, Daniel went around the long table, complimenting the dishes there, the [vitello tonnato](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#vitellotonnato), the [pesce finto](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#pescefinto), the tomato and onion salad, [carne cruda all'Albese](zzz#carnecruda), prosciutto and chicken in gelatin.

Daniel admired the calm and strength of Amalia. Despite everything happening around her, she had the strength to clean up the room and make dinner. Without a doubt, thought Daniel, there was also an entirely feminine display in that staging of bourgeois serenity, of the family meal, and also a strong signal directed at Giulio, [to want to tell him that for her the adversity would straighten them out](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#drizzarelaschiena).

"Have I forgotten anything?" she asked slyly, looking at Daniel and then the table, and already knowing the response. 

"Some flowers," he said.

Daniel felt guilty: "Going to the countryside, one never thinks to bring some flowers," he stammered, "really, with one thing and the other, we didn't bring anything."

"All of you are enough," Amalia said, looking towards Giulio, then taking shears from a drawer, opening the door and going down the stairs. 

Daniel looked out and saw her going down to the old vines, sure-footed on the thick soil, upright, with her great mass of hair billowing in the evening air. Then he lost her behind a hill but still sensed her location from the sound of twigs that broke under her footsteps.

He turned to Giulio and said, "Force yourself, try not to stay silent the entire evening. Go look for the girls, it's ready."

While Giulio disappeared into the hallway, Daniel saw that there wasn't any bread on the table and again leaning out the window, asked, in a loud voice, "Amalia, where can I find the bread?"

He heard his voice echoing clearly in the valley, and the voice of Amalia, very near, reply "Look in the cupboard, near the door. There should also be some fresh breadsticks."
