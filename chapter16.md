The vulgar voices erupted as if from a single mouth. They rose together with a greasy smoke from the courtyard which stretched a light blue sheet across the window opening, then tore itself apart inside the room where they had just sat down. 

"Again this evening..." said Amalia, getting up and going to close the window. 

The two girls were sitting beside Amalia, in front of Giulio; for Daniel all that remained was to take the head of the table, with his back to the window, from where, now, the curtain of smoke unraveled over the table. Daniel tried to break it up by fanning it with a napkin. 

"What are they doing?" asked Nicole, standing up and going to the window, followed by Maria.

Daniel looked at Amalia, who had sat back down and Giulio, who was gnawing on a breadstick.

The voices now mingled with the sounds of plates and glasses, with songs and laughter.

From behind the shutters the two girls commented: 

"How ugly they are..."

"Only males..."

"The whores arrive later," Amalia snapped, "when they're already half-drunk: Nigerians, Slavs, Albanians, poor girls... They load them in the car and [bring them back to the house](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#riportano). Do we want them to ruin dinner also?"

Amalia turned with a questioning look to her brother, who continued to nibble on a breadstick and didn't dare serve himself. 

"Come on girls, sit down..."

The girls came back and sat down and served themselves [insalata russa](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#insalatarussa), while Daniel took the [carne cruda](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#carnecruda), cut into thin slices, and asked himself where Flop could be.

"Do you know *Dolcetto di Chionetti*?" Amalia asked, pointing to the bottle in the middle of the table, "it's made by Quinto and Andrea in Dogliani."

"14 percent alcohol for a Dolcetto is a lot, too much," Daniel said taking the bottle and pouring a glass for Amalia, Maria, and Nicole, and placing the bottle in front of Giulio.

"Tell that to the Germans and the Swiss who, with the price of Dolcetto, want the impact of a Barolo in their stomachs and in their heads," answered Amalia.

"2003 was a year of extreme heat," said Giulio, pouring himself a drink, "an excess of sugar."

"It's always like that now," said Amalia, "it's climate change." 

Daniel asked himself if the talk about wine constituted neutral territory, or if they weren't walking on the edge of a precipice, and he bit his tongue as he was about to say "Here's the land of Barbaresco."

"I've drunk South African Merlot from Olifants River Valley that was much lighter than a Carsico or a Friulano. Now they also do well with Chardonnay and Cabernet, all well structured, complex, and with less alcohol."

Daniel shook his head. Tell that to those who are trying to make a Barolo or a Barbaresco, a Brunello, a proper Chianti, or a Burgundy or Bordeaux. If you don't have that land there, under the grape clusters and the firmly planted roots, they remain copies, imitations: wines for simple palates that drink the names and the labels.

Maria followed their discussion, but Nicole was bored, touching the arm of her friend to pull her into another conversation. So Daniel paused and turned toward Nicole and asked, "Nicole, have I ever asked you if you like wine?"
<!-- Page 125 -->

The question came to him without thinking, and after saying it Daniel reflected that it was exactly so, that he'd never asked her if she liked wine, and not because he hadn't had the the time or the occasion, but because he took it for granted, he saw that she drank it in moderation, and to him that was good, better wine than all the rest.

"Do you like it?" he repeated, smiling at her.

Nicole shrugged and said, "Since Maria told me that it's not a beverage, it's a blend of nuances, yes." 

She had replied in a naive and cheerful tone, and Daniel was impressed. He who'd studied and lived with those nuances had never succeeded in formulating such a simple definition. He looked at Nicole, looked at Maria. He looked at Amalia, hoping that for her the look also had the nuances that he wanted.

The sudden silence between them was interrupted by the repeated sounds of bottles being shattered. 

"The target practice has started. Imbeciles," said Amalia, getting up and going to open the window, immediately followed by the girls and Daniel.

Below, in the yard, in front of the long table, against the farmhouse wall, Baravalle and his friends had built a pyramid of empty bottles.

"The game of these imbeciles consists of shooting down the highest bottle without making the bottles below it fall, and then, gradually working their way down..."

They had taken off their shirts, some remained in their undershirts, some stripped to the waist, then the women had arrived, some dancing, others eating while being poked and prodded by strong and careless hands.

Daniel looked down and then, hearing a noise behind him, turned around just in time to see Giulio stand up suddenly from his seat to get to the stairs. Daniel moved quickly across the room and locked the door. He grabbed him and squeezed, looking him in the eyes. He said to him, "Just wait before you go down, you understand?"
<!-- Page 126 -->

"How much do you want us humbled, Giulio... how much?" Amalia had said, without leaving the window, with an almost imploring tone, full of gentleness and pain. Then, without waiting for answer that she knew, at least in words, wouldn't come, she crossed the room, went to the cupboard, and took out a bottle of clear liquid. She returned to the window and hurled it forcefully towards the pile of old furniture, sending it crashing against the back of an iron bed. Then she pulled a box of kitchen matches from her pocket, lit one, and dropped it between the broken bottles. The flame in contact with the alcohol started a horizontal bluish blaze, rising up immediately, blood-red, becoming a bonfire. Meanwhile screams and curses rose from the yard, and the men and women fled through the vines and along the avenue of beech trees, leaving shirts and purses on the chairs and table. The room had grown silent: Amalia, leaning on the windowsill, watched the tall tongues of fire lick the wall of the house. Nicole and Maria had embraced each other. Daniel, followed by Giulio, rushed down the stairs and out onto the yard, and now they turned towards the bonfire to gauge its strength and the danger.

In the distance, from the depths of the vines, was heard a hoarse voice, half-drunk, furious, screaming: "Amalia, you're crazy..."

"This is still my house."

Daniel turned toward the window, from where that harsh reply had come. And he saw Amalia with a mocking smile on her lips, her head proud, a long neck as white as the teeth she now opened in childish laughter.

Daniel started towards the stairs, preceded by Giulio, holding in his hands a rag doll that he'd stolen from the flames of the pile of furniture.

It was then that Flop began barking.
