"A monotonous landscape: hills and hills of vines, all the same. Not even a fruit tree. Do you see a cherry tree, peach tree, or plum tree around? No, nothing. All the orchards were cut down to make way for the vineyards. Some hazelnuts are holding out where Ferrero Chocolate pays for it. A desert of vines with a trellis of roses, just to please the old people who are still around. Do you see a vegetable garden? [Also gone](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#alsogone). Then there is the Co-op and the [Fortress of Petrini](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#presidio), [out there somewhere](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#wanderingabout). And then there's the University of Gastronomics in Pollenzo. Did you know that we have a University of Gastromics where people come from all over the world to study the history of nutrition, and where there's a wine cellar with vaults that the Bank of Italy doesn't even have? They buy the wine and leave it there as if it were stocks. Is that a beautiful fantasy, or what?"

Daniel had opened the window, the air conditioning was making him sneeze, and he now felt the dry heat of corn scratching his throat, filtering through his nostrils. Thirst and thoughts were going through him and beating his temples. If Nicole were coming into Nice would it be ok to ask Amalia to accompany him? Would Nicole be irritated or would a female presence make her feel more secure? Would Amalia agree to accompany him? Or would it be better to fetch her by himself? He feared a journey of long silences, eyes down, nails bitten nervously. They were like that on their weekends, in Paris, on the rare occasions that he could see her, between a restaurant, a department store, and a movie theater.

He asked, "Do you have family?"

Luciano slowed down. He said, "My name is Luciano, if you believe it... Yes, but I hardly ever see them... I'm on the road all day, often at night... at Caselle or Malpensa... sometimes Nice also. Companies cut costs... representatives or directors go back the same day."

"Children?" asked Daniel.

"A boy, 15 years old. He plays [*Pallone Elastio*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#pallone). He'll be a winemaker like his mother wants. Silvia is 18, a real martian. We stopped talking to each other a couple of years ago, and since then things have improved. Every now and then we exchange a smile. And let's say that my wife is a teacher. Home education is not lacking..."

Luciano left the sentence hanging and Daniel thought he was possibly finished. He said, "Is all this education useful?"

"Newspapers, television, movies and this internet... ask me if they're of use. My colleagues have installed GPS in their cars, to tell them where Prunetto or Camerana are. As if they didn't know it like their own noses, all their lives. Understand?"

"*Slow down...first exit, 100 meters on the right...*" Daniel laughed, remembering when, with Marc, they had used GPS in their Toyota to get to Fontainebleau. 

"Will it be education then, Luciano, or just another consumer commodity? Knowledge and information, like beer cans, boxes of detergent, cookies..."

"At worst, I still prefer these hills. You should see them in the winter when there's [salt fog](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#saltfog) and everything stops, except the dampness: a web of drops of water that climbs everywhere and seems like the inside of a large chandelier. There's no noise, unless some branch finds the strength to break or some stone breaks in the cold. The frost paves the roads and you go on them like the keyboard of an out of tune piano. Only barking dogs behind [a fence](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#afence) that have same color of the fog remind you of the Langhe [of old](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ofold). The villages curl up in a ball: whoever can, and there are many, go to the Maldives or the Seychelles. And those who are waiting to leave, in the meantime shut themselves up in a tavern to make barbecue or to prepare wine tastings for Saturday and Sunday, saddled with citizens who've just stood up from plates of [*bollito*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#bollito) or [*fritto misto*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#frittomisto). It's a good time to buy back the farms that the Germans and the English, and also people from Turin, Genoa, or Milan, bought in the spring."

Then he laughed "Want to stop for something to drink?" 

They were in Bergolo, in the upper Uzzone valley, Luciano told him as they got out of the car.

"From here you can see the Langhe of Asti, the villages of Roccaverano, Olmo Gentile, San Giorgio Scarampi, the valley of the Bormida."

It was a land of geraniums, red, blue, and white: they came down from the small windows of the stone houses, drawing fragrant arabesques on the walls.

"The poor villages of Alta Langhe. Here, the wine hasn't come, [unfortunately, and fortunately, nature is still theirs, and if they know to keep it that way maybe they'll find a little bit of well-being](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#unfortunately)."

Daniel shook his head, he said: "Some tourists hike, some get a room in an *agriturismo*, a little bit of nostalgia for home, for old times... it's tough, Luciano. There are corners of the world that return to being unlivable, and you can't do anything, just worry and hunger are possible for them, and so to speak, a bit of life... a bit of further misery. Hunger and worry. [How long can stubbornness or dignity keep countries from going to nothing, and I don't speak of that?](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#howlongcan)."

"The world doesn't have a middle ground?" asked Luciano, heading towards the terrace of the bar on the piazza.

"It seems not. Either one tries to become rich or is poor..." said Daniel.

"[Or are consumers or the consumed](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#orconsumers)?" asked Luciano. 

They were seated in white plastic chairs. 

"[Invent some contraption and harvest more than all the Barolo in Cannubi](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#inventsuch)," Luciano said, and added: "Looking for a glass of Favorita?"

Daniel nodded, "If there's nothing local..."

Tourists with backpacks and shorts crossed the piazza, waving.

"There's a village with bungalows higher up, with swimming pools and tennis courts and sun every day, which is full from June to September, then it closes. They came to put it up from Savona, helped by the [Mountain Community](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#mountaincommunity), inter-regional funding, and funds from the European Community. People who know how to get the money out of the coffers in Brussels."

The waiter arrived with a white wine, a beer, a plate of olives and slices of salami.

"*Alla salute*" said Daniel, lifting his glass. 

"*Alla salute*" Luciano responded, raising his bottle of beer. 

"Favorita has less structure than Arneis, right?" asked Luciano. 

"Yes, milder, less composed, reminds me of the Ligurian Vermentino that my grandfather made, in an inland town near the old border with Italy. Same feeling."

"Your grandfather was a wine-maker?"

"Stationmaster, but he still had a piece of land. That's where I learned to sense the first smells under the vine. The dandelion, the hay, the nightshade. My grandfather taught me to not pull them out, saying that they were absorbed by the plant and would spice up the berries."

"If they want that, today they do it with chemistry, a lot of this a lot of that. They clone animals, who knows what flavors..."

Daniel finished his glass, took an olive and got up. He said, "Luciano, I have to go to Nice, would you take me?"

"Let me know a few days in advance..." Luciano responded, then looked at him and added "even less... it's been a year since I've seen the sea" and he laughed.

The room was in the shade. Flop slept in the bathroom, crouched under the sink. Silvio had assented as he went up to the room, and had just said to keep him in the bathroom so he wouldn't leave an odor in the room. Daniel had asked for a bowl of water and assured him that he'd soon find accommodations, maybe he could leave him at Ginotta, where he was going to speak with the Giacosas.

"They wouldn't know where to begin with a dog..."
