They had passed through the Tenda tunnel, precariously just missing some trucks speeding in the narrow and dark tunnel, and emerged into the scattered blue light of the Mediterranean, which bounced among the pines clinging to the alpine gorges. And now they descended towards La Brigue, where Eta Beta asked to stop. Daniel had timidly protested, but Eta Beta had calmed him, saying that they had plenty of time, that it was useless to shut themselves in an airport where you couldn't smoke and where the shops full of summer clothes [would make them feel even colder](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#wouldmakethem). 

Eta Beta not only peed but wanted to have a coffee, and then, praising the Brigasca sheep, similar to but smaller than the Frabosana, bought some [toma, sora, and brus](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#tomasorabrus). Floriana begged him to wrap the brus well in foil, and when he came out from Alimentari market she opened the trunk, where Eta Beta stowed them with care.

"One can tell where these come from: by their odors, by their shape, their recognizable flavors. They have a name. On the other hand, Giacomo didn't know where Francesca came from. She was a girl, a woman, who knew all the places on the Riviera coast, she could belong to Laugueglia as well as to Riva, to Diano as well as to Bordighera."

"Didn't she speak about the town with the port?" Floriana asked.

"Yes, this was the impression that came out of the rare speeches that Francesca made about her residence," answered Eta Beta, stretching out in the seat and wrapping himself more and more in his blue coat. "A small city with a port, yes. She told Giacomo that during her lunch break she was going to do her last sunbathing on the beach or walking on the pier. In my imagination, I always pictured a place like Camogli, a fishing village, perched above the sea, leaning over its small port, with its narrow alleys that intertwine like veins in a body, its sunny bends, and shaded paths. Or more cheerfully, perhaps Riviera di Ponente. And then she spoke of a train station, which Camogli doesn't have. Once she wrote to him: 'The almond tree by the station already has leaves' and he thought that perhaps he could arrive by train, step onto the platform, and kiss Francesca, who would be waiting for him under the flowering almond tree. Here, he imagined her in a rocky village, a stone rose, as Roth would have said &ndash; Joseph, not Philip. Two roses, actually, because she had her thorns, a strong character, stubborn, defensive, ready to attack if it seemed she had received a snub."
<!-- Page 97 -->

"If Giacomo never met her where she lived, where did he meet her then?" asked Daniel, more out of courtesy than interest. Stories of love gone wrong all seemed the same and boring, his own included.

"In Menton, in Sanremo, in Cervo, wherever his job would take him. One time they went down to the beach at Balzi Rossi. He understood from some of her hints that they were places she'd gone to as a girl, especially the beach at Darsenone, the one with the fisherman's huts. Indeed, in time he thought he understood that, along with Giacomo, she was regressing into the past, to when she was eighteen, nineteen years old, to summertime, that time of light clothing, of sun that lasts long on the skin, of bathing in the moonlight, of intoxicating songs that seem to freeze time.
<br/> <br/> <br/>
<!-- Page 98 -->

"Giacomo found himself experiencing parallel memories of places, moments and situations in which they had seen and experienced similar sensations. Francesca remembered the names of people he had known, [disappointments that he had felt weighing indelibly on his heart](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#delusioni).

"They were traveling in the night, she was driving and it was in those intervals, between one lamppost and another along the waterfront, that Giacomo observed the profile of a prehistoric animal, the beauty frozen, carved. She pointed out that he didn't talk much, that he was one of few words.

"Giacomo would have liked to tell her that they were going through 'the silence' of lovers, that dawn of love that replaces words with glances, holding hands, kissing."
<br/><br/><br/>

"When did they kiss each other for the first time?" Floriana asked brightly.

"They had been eating on the waterfront, between Ventimiglia and Bordighera. She told him he had the hands of a child, she had cleaned his glasses:  gestures that Giacomo didn't how to interpret, except as affectionate, but also maternal. Leaving the restaurant, they had walked on the beach, intrigued by a fisherman jumping on the rocks, who was making short casts and pulling in the line. He was wearing bright shoes that showed his rapid, zigzagging, movements. Giacomo was on her left, they had entered a narrow moonbeam descending from the heavens and reflecting off the sea onto the white stones of the beach. Suddenly he was leaning over her, meeting her lips that weren't open, but also weren't moved away.

"Then, one day she wrote to him: 'When I see you I want to kiss you non-stop.' And they had seen each other, Giacomo and Francesca, and they had kissed each other for a long time, in the car, between the boats in dock, then in a dark parking lot. That was the first and only time.
<!-- Page 99 -->

"Then the Christmas holidays came, Francesca left for the mountains, she went to Val d'Is&egrave;re in France with her children, and from there she began to complain, saying that she was in love and alone. Then one day she wrote to Giacomo, 'Never a serious talk.' What serious talks could Giacomo have had with her, except those proving to her his deep feelings? And that was the start of the end of their story. 

"A few days later, she wrote that she was in love and happy and that she would be away from the office for a week."
<br/><br/><br/>

They had emerged in Ventimiglia, Floriana took the ramp for the autostrada to France. Eta Beta had interrupted his story, he seemed to have no more to say or was maybe waiting for questions, but Floriana and Daniel didn't know what to add, except that the story seemed disjointed, just like life itself, and that love was just a part of it.

Daniel said, "In half an hour we'll be there. I hope everything goes smoothly."

Floriano reached for his hand. She said, "Everything will go fine Daniel... [we are many](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#siamointanti)."

"We are a surprise..." added Eta Beta.

In front of them was the sea, which rose like a Spring wall of purple bougainvillea. They glided on the high viaducts, suspended between olive and pine trees, towards the airport in Nice, where they arrived a half hour later.

"Gate 9," said Daniel.

They left the car in the parking lot, exited into an intense perfume of pink oleander, and walked towards the entrance. Eta Beta complained about the air conditioning and rolled up his scarf around his neck, Daniel put on his jacket, Floriana laughed. They arrived at Gate 9 and lined up behind the barricades. 

<!-- Page 100 -->

Suddenly Daniel was attracted by a figure who was vaguely familiar, but at the same time utterly unknown. He was a tall, slender, youth, hair black and smooth, with a white linen suit of an excellent cut. He had a blue shirt with wide lapels, open at the neck, where there hung a gold chain. He looked uncertainly at the departures board. Daniel stood staring for a long time, trying not to attract his attention, then approached him, circling around a couple of times. Then, shocked, he took his arm, and in turn he felt someone take his elbow, while the voice of Eta Beta told him, "Here's Nicole."

Daniel turned, he remained uncertain for a moment, then he embraced his daughter, who returned the hug with a slight resistance, and asked, "Who is that, Dad?"

Daniel looked at Eta Beta, shrugging his shoulders as if wanting to say he was not quite sure if he knew him, and at the same time he grabbed the young man dressed in white saying, loudly, "He's here, it's Giulio!"

For different reasons, Floriana, Nicole, and Giulio were surprised by the vehemence of Daniel's statement, spoken with such force. The only one who didn't seem surprised was Eta Beta who, prudently, went behind Giulio, almost wanting to prevent a possible escape.

Giulio, after an instant of surprise and embarrassment, looked at Nicole and tried to smile at her. 

"You're in Nice also...?" he mumbled.

"Yes, but we're going back to Langhe, right?" said Daniel, who hadn't let go of his arm. 

"It Alba far?" Nicole asked, addressing Floriana.

"If we don't stop too many times, in 4 hours of easy travel we'll get there."

"Nicole, did you have a good trip?" asked Daniel, who had entrusted Giulio to Eta Beta, and now took her gently under his arm.
<!-- Page 101 -->

"Finally you ask me," said Nicole, pouting. "You came with a regiment to pick me up..."

"I'll explain later, Nicole, coincidences, events... it's all happened in these last few days."

"Who are these people?"

As they were leaving the airport, Daniel and Nicole were interrupted by Floriana, who said, "You'll have to squeeze a bit in the car, there are two more..."

"I have a car," said Giulio.

Daniel looked at him &ndash; not if it would let him escape. He said, "You're coming with us."

Giulio shrugged his shoulders. "I can't leave the car here. I rented it in Bra, and have to return it."

Daniel looked at him angrily, he wanted to remind him that something else had to be returned. It wasn't the time. He said, with a tone that couldn't be contradicted, "It's better if you come with us."

"I'd like to drive," Nicole interjected. "Can I?"

Daniel looked at Eta Beta. Eta Beta nodded and said, "Daniel, go with your daughter. She doesn't know how to drive. [Perhaps, automotively speaking, it's not the best crew, but it is from a sentimental point of view](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#dalpuntodivista). We'll follow you, just in case. Okay?"

"But who is that?" Nicole asked, amused.

"I'll explain later, let's go. Do you remember how to drive?"

Daniel put his arm around her shoulders and they walked toward the parking lot.

A few steps back, Giulio, between Eta Beta and Floriana, adjusted his bulky shirt collar. 

Eta Beta resumed his position, stretched out in the back seat, while Giulio, who had offered to drive, had settled alongside Floriana, who would have gladly ceded the driving to him through Tenda to look at the scenery.
<!-- Page 102 -->

Nicole and Daniel set out slowly. Floriana missed the exit from the airport a few times, then found the signs and accelerated.

"[It's difficult for the daughter in that difficult relationship that is father-daughter](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#figliadifficile)," said Eta Beta. 

"What relationship isn't?" Floriana answered.

Eta Beta ignored the question and leaned between the two passengers. "Look, Daniel's asking if she can drive a manual transmission, see, he's showing here the stick shift. [From this distance](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#dalontano), he'd like to tell her that he's glad she came, [that he had lost hope](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#chenoncisperava). He'd like to ask her how she is, but he's afraid asking such a direct question would irritate her. He points to the landscape, tells her about it so she's not distracted."

They entered the tunnel, and when they emerged they were above Monte Carlo. Floriana slowed down, moving the car towards the guardrail, while Daniel was pointing towards the high-rises of the Principality. 

"Nicole's never been to Monte Carlo. Why doesn't Daniel stop talking and tell her to go down there? She seems interested, and he could earn some points."

"Let's suggest it to them," said Giulio, who had remained in an embarrassed silence until that moment. Then he called a number on his cell phone and a few moments later they saw Daniel hold a cell phone to his ear. 

"Can you talk to them?" said Giulio, handing it to Eta Beta. 

"Daniel, why not go down to Monte Carlo, Nicole might like it..."

Daniel mumbled something incomprehensible that must have been a 'yes,' because after a few kilometers they saw his car take the exit ramp to Monte Carlo.

"She wanted to... sometimes it just takes a little to please someone..." snorted Eta Beta.

"Daniel is a sensible person," said Floriana, "but he's a father. My father was capable of not saying a word to me for weeks, and our situation at home wasn't like theirs, although it wasn't easy. He looked at me and it was enough. I saw in his look the words that he didn't say, they were affectionate, delicate. But they never came out."
<!-- Page 103 -->

They went down a narrow road cut into the rock and holding back the Aleppo pines, and emerged into Monte Carlo. They passed the Casino and the *Hotel de Paris* and went down towards the port, to the parking lot in front of the Yachting Club.

Nicole was looking around, and seemed happy. Daniel was near her, ignoring Giulio and Eta Beta and trying to draw Floriana into their conversation. 

They looked at the large yachts at anchor with their helicopters on deck and crews in uniform, took the escalator and went up to the Ranieri Castle, finally seating themselves in a terrace with yellow and blue awnings to drink fruit juice, while Eta Beta had ordered a hot tea that provoked Nicole to say: "Smart, when it's warm it's better to drink warm," with the immediate response from Eta Beta, "I'm very cold, young lady," and her rejoinder, "Maybe you're in love."

Eta Beta didn't speak again until they again departed for Italy, leaning forward between Floriana and Giulio.

"[They're loosening up](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#sisonosciolti)," he said, "Daniel stroked her hair, did you see that?"

"It takes a lot and nothing," said Floriana, "just one clumsy adjective, rude, and everything is like it was before. Her nerves are on edge, Nicole, have you noticed the way she laughs? She's tense, irritable." 

"[That she is](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#quellasifa)," Giulio said, "since Nice she hasn't said much, trying to keep Daniel at a distance, and directing her words almost exclusively to Eta Beta."

"Not only that," said Floriana.

"A broken family situation," added Giulio. Floriana shook her head. 

She said, "She's uncomfortable with herself. She doesn't know..."

"Doesn't know what?" asked Giulio, curious.

<!-- Page 104 -->
They had left Ventimiglia and had taken the road to Roja. They stopped under a clump of eucalyptus trees, and Floriana and Giulio swapped driving duties, then Giulio accelerated and reached the car driven by Nicole.

"I think you're right, Floriana, when you talk about dangerous adjectives. Some must have come out," Eta Beta said. "Look at their heads, they aren't moving, they're looking straight ahead, they aren't saying a word."

"Maybe they're thinking of their own affairs," Giulio said.

"Maybe they're reflecting on what they said," added Floriana.

"I might be wrong," continued Eta Beta, "but to me they seem resentful. There must be something they're holding against each other. But it's normal, there's the immediate joy of seeing each other, then you go back to where you left off. The physiology of love, Barthes would say, of any type of love. Here it's up to Daniel to recover..."

"He's the parent," Giulio said with a strange vehemence, "he's the father, the bullshit is his responsibility."

"Too easy," Floriana said, without turning her gaze to the side of the roads that bounced over the Roja between olive trees and villages that crumbled under the setting sun.

"Too easy," continued Floriana, "you have to feel for yourself what is right. [If you screw up it's because you want to, but then you have to justify it, and not with bullshit](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#sesgarri)." Even Floriana was determined, almost harsh, and Giulio remained silent, without replying. 

"They're stopping to get gas," advised Eta Beta, who had seemed to have fallen asleep. 

The two cars stopped in the self-service area of Q8 gas, and Giulio got out to tell Nicole that it was a diesel and offered to get the diesel fuel. Daniel let him do it while continuing to look at him with severity and detachment, so much so that Floriana pointed out to Eta Beta: 

"Jealous just like all fathers when a young male approaches their daughter. So was my father, and he had no reason..." Floriana had turned towards Eta Beta. 
<!-- Page 105 -->

"Perhaps in this case too, Daniel shouldn't worry about it," Eta Beta said.

Floriana looked at him, looked at Nicole near Giulio, then turned back toward Eta Beta with a light irony in her eyes, and let out a burst of brief, cheerful, laughter. She said, "It was a thought that had crossed my mind, but hadn't taken into consideration... I was biased."

"It's another reason why Daniel now can't bear the presence of Giulio." It was the response, almost brusque, of Eta Beta, who then added, in a softer tone, "[And one of many reasons](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#contutteleragioni)."

Floriana fell silent. [She waited until Giulio got back to the car and the two cars left again to return to looking at the hills](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#atteseche) which grew into mountains with ever higher villages glued to their steep walls.

They had passed Libre, Trucco, Saorge, and the bridge of Briga, and climbed into the shade of linden trees that perfumed the road and threw shadows across the car. Giulio led the way, driving carefully, and Floriana seemed drawn into the landscape, increasingly intense in its gray-colored rocks, red maples, and old abandoned houses.

"Nicole has asked Daniel something, look..." said Giulio, getting the attention of Floriana and Eta Beta, "he's touched her arm... the calm after the storm. Right?"

"Sometimes," said Eta Beta, getting up and leaning towards the front seat, "you feel at home, and there things are forgiven, or else are buried under embers that never go out, as long as the fire isn't quenched or there's a split between the litigants. In the first case, it's possible for the relationships to return to normal, in the second, it depends on the private lives of the individual combatants and on their vanity, on the narcissistic time that they've devoted to themselves."

"Now it's he who's again putting a hand on the back of her neck," said Giulio, who didn't seem to have heard the words of Eta Beta. 

"Look, he's continuing to caress her and she's laughing," continued Giulio, childishly clapping his hands.

"Perhaps from here," added Floriana, "their vacation begins. Where are we?"
