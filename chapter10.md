<!-- Pages 76-93 -->
It was a wasted trip. They'd arrived at night, and had returned at night. Giulo wasn't staying with Ribotti. And Daniel had begun to believe that Lovera and Luciano were right: Giulio was locked in some hotel room to get over his despair, or maybe just his anger. Types like him still believed that they had been wronged.

It was two in the morning when he returned to his room, greeted by a jubilant, and definitely hungry, Flop. Daniel patted him on the head and gave him a loaf of bread that he'd taken from the winery. He turned on the water in the bidet and gave him a drink. Then he took off his shoes and jacket and lay on the bed. 

"He'll come back," Amalia had told him, bitterly. "He can't go anywhere... poor guy." And in that *poor guy* he had caught resentment and a reprimand to herself. 

It was a world of sick feelings. Where to start, Daniel had asked himself, listening to Flop chew the bread slowly and, he would have said, with more respect than voracity. 
<br/><br/><br/>

On the Ginotta grounds, Baravalle had filled folding tables full of food and was celebrating. On an impromptu barbecue made with stones and a grill, he cooked steaks, sausages, and vegetables for friends who came and went, to admire his conquest up close. 
<!-- Page 77 -->

Amalia had closed many of the interior doors of the house, but that didn't stop Baravalle from climbing the stairs to a side door and showing the rooms of the farmhouse. Inside he was more cautious, but in the yard and in the vineyards he seemed like the owner of all Ginotta. Amalia, behind the shutters, was despairing and in the grip of an uncontrollable rage. She saw Baravalle in his undershirt, with a straw hat on his head, sitting at the head of the table, declaring that he would have turned over his part and, without despairing, all of the hills of the vineyard.

They came again in the evening, they brought musicians and prostitutes whom they danced with, and then vanished into the house.

Daniel had suggested to Amalia to be patient, to let the euphoria subside, that the exhibition and the revelry would last no more than a week, and then even Baravalle's ego would be deflated. That she had to think about how to regain possession of Ginotta, and for that they wanted good lawyers and mediators.

"I can offer a fair price, even more, and am willing to offer him the equivalent of lodgings in Independence piazza, but I'm sure he won't accept."

"Don't be hasty, Amalia, take your time. It's a game where you get exhausted. The important thing is that you remain at Ginotta as the true owner," he suggested.

"And how do I do that, if he comes with his friends and his sluts [and sets up a brothel until dawn](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#andsetsup)? They come and drink under my window... 'Come and have a glass, Amalia...' the Baravalle's repugnance is provoking me."

"[Restore life to these walls](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#restorelife)," Daniel said to her.

"Now's not the best time, don't you think?"

Indeed, it wasn't. But precisely because of that, Amalia had to find the energy to do it. She said that to him, and he didn't ask her if, the next day, she would accompany him to Nice to pick up Nicole. Amalia, understandably, had forgotten about it. But he hadn't, and he realized it was the worst time for Nicole to be with him. But he didn't feel like leaving the one in Paris, nor abandoning the other in Alba.
<br/> <br/> <br/>
<!-- Page 78 -->

To be punctual for the plane's 5:20 pm arrival, Daniel had asked Luciano to pick him up at the *Savona* at 10, so they'd have plenty of time. The evening before he had eaten in the hotel with Amalia, who had promised to bring Flop to Ginotta. 

"He'll guard it, you'll see..."

"What's left of it..."

Daniel had reached his arm across the table and pressed his hand in hers. 

"I feel it'll work out, I don't know how. But I feel it'll be alright in the end."

Amalia shook her head. 

"I don't have any idea... yesterday I was with the police sergeant. They're discreetly searching for Giulio. According to them, he's not around here, they've some inquiries at some [control stations](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#controlli): nothing. It's possible that he took a train and is in France."

Amalia shrugged her shoulders and added: "I'm worried, but I know he'll come back."

They had parted at the door of the *Savona* with a kiss on the cheeks. Flop, who wore a leash that Silvio had improvised with a rope, didn't want to go down the few steps.

"For just that reason, I don't feel that I should go with you, you understand. Ok?" she had told him. 

He responded yes, [that he thought he understood everything](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thathethought).
<br/> <br/> <br/>

Luciano phoned at a quarter to 10: a complication prevented him from coming to pick him up. He was mortified, his wife had had a heart attack and he had rushed to the hospital. He gave him telephone numbers of a couple of his colleagues. Daniel had tried to call them: one didn't respond, the other was in Casalle Airport waiting for a client from Naples. 

<!-- Page 79 -->
"What do I do?" Daniel asked himself, agitated.
<br/> <br/> <br/>

Daniel lights his first cigarette of the day, cursing the unexpected difficulty. He couldn't arrive late to Nice. He wouldn't be able to forgive himself. And they wouldn't forgive him.

He sits at a table, looks at the time, and orders an aperitif, a Pastis. He knows it's early and that surely [his head will be pounding](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#batteraintesta), but the agitation that is overtaking him is rising. Within himself he begins to feel that he doesn't know how to resolve his problem. [He hears himself saying: "Make something happen. I beg you: make something happen and find a solution."](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#hehearshimself) He says it clenching his fists, looking at the Pastis that Silvio had brought him, along with a small carafe of ice water. 

Then he feels steps behind him and a cold draft, as if it were the air conditioning. He turns around.

"May I?"

Daniel looks up at the man who is now in front of him and has placed a hand, white and slender, on the back of the chair. He is tall and thin, hair slightly gray around the temples, has a clear and reassuring look, a gentle smile, calm. He's wearing a blue coat and a red scarf. Daniel nods and points to the chair that the stranger has already moved. He takes off his coat and puts in on the next table. He's dressed in light brown velvet, a black vest, and a red tie with a large knot, wide and loose at the base. 

The stranger sits, stretching out and folding his hands on the table.

"[He could show up here, now, a repentant Giulio with the car, to offer to accompany you to Nice. And for you to get to Nice in time would help him to be, I won't say, forgiven by Amalia, but let's say be accepted as a prodigal son with whom she'll fix the accounts over time. True?](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#hecouldshowup)"

<!-- Page 80 -->

Daniel, confused, nods.

"A convenient solution, and a little too easy, don't you think?"

The stranger asks Silvio if it would be possible to get some tea.

"Do you know the *Mariage Fr&egrave;res* from Paris? Imported, and judged a most exquisite tea. And they take care to stop it up with a strong and deep cork, a true watertight seal. We were saying?"

Daniel looks confusedly at his Pastis: he had finished it without realizing it. He orders a second one from Silvio.

"Don't overdo it, Daniel. Remember, we have to go to Nice. There's a long way to go, and there are many curves. Wouldn't it be better to eat something?"

"You're taking me to Nice?" Daniel asks hopefully, pushing away the Pastis, which Silvio had put on the table along with a pot of hot water and a cup containing a tea bag.

The stranger takes the string of the tea bag, raises it with an annoyed look, then puts it back down on the bottom of the cup and pours a little water.

"Not driving," he said, "I don't drive anymore. An annoying retinal detachment, alas, has prevented me for years. But I'll gladly go in the car. A trip to Nice will be a pleasure."

"How do we get there?" asks Daniel, looking at the second glass of Pastis, which Silvio hadn't taken off the table.

The stranger sips with light disgust from his glass of tea. Then, very slowly, as if he were talking to himself, asks, "Who do we have here that could take us, since Luciano is grappling with one of his wife's usual attacks of coronary arrhythmia?"

"Who?" Daniel asks, with increasing anxiety, "I wouldn't really know who..."

The stranger moves in his chair, making cracking noises in his legs. He asks Silvio, without raising his voice, to look up the number of the *Hotel Cavalieri*. Then, pulling a cell phone out of pocket, waits for Silvio to get back to him.

He dials the number and hands it to Daniel, saying "Try to see if Maria is at the hotel, and if she doesn't have a better plan than a nice trip to Nice. I doubt it..."
<!-- Page 81 -->

Daniel takes the phone, mumbles Maria's name, says: "Of course... Maria... I hadn't thought of that..." then the reception asks whom he would like to speak with, and he says "Miss Suzuki." And when she's connected to him, with unexpected self-confidence he explains his problem to her, which the stranger corrects to "our" problem. Daniel pays no attention and continues to speak, explaining to Maria that for him it's a vital issue.

When he returns the phone to the stranger, he smiles. He says "She was very willing: Gaja is in Bolgheri and has postponed their meeting. She's coming, and will be here in 10 minutes."

"I didn't doubt it," says the stranger, continuing to drink his tea with grimaces of annoyance.

"How could you know?" Daniel asks.

"It's my job. I write stories," the stranger says, getting up and putting on his coat. Daniel shrugs, his head slightly dizzy and his mind disposed to anything.

"But aren't you warm, dressed like that?"

"The story, Daniel, that of Amalia and Giulio, of Nicole and of Ginotta, belongs to the late spring. I live, actually, in the winter and the long-tailed tits who arrive each year from Alaska to seek out the Langhe hills here between Barbaresco and Neive. And also inside my heart, like crystals of snow." 

Daniel was becoming too impatient to comment on the words of the unknown writer. He had already gotten up and advised Silvio to prepare the most comfortable room in the hotel, and not far from his. Then he headed toward the exit. 
<!-- Page 82 -->

Maria was beautiful, elegant in her light black pantsuit by Kenzo, the jacket very tight, over a very white shirt, with a collar rounded or lifted, and a pink necklace of river pearls. She wore yellow canvas shoes with white tips.

She too, after seeing the stranger, asked, "Won't you get hot?"

"It's my season," he replied, tilting his head and kissing her hand lightly, before getting in the car behind the passenger's seat, and adding, "To stretch out my legs."

"Who is he?" asked Maria, amused, while Daniel sat down beside her. 

Daniel didn't have time to answer, because the stranger answered the question as if it were addressed directly to him.

"One of many... like everyone, with a name that we haven't chosen, and which rarely corresponds to us. You, for example, are named Maria, a name for devout Catholics, but also for the laity, very important, loaded with reverence, but yet it doesn't match, pardon my frankness. I will call you Floriana. I hope that's ok with you."

Maria laughed. She said "No one from Osaka and Tokyo ever had that problem. They take it, first of all, as an exotic name, you might say, or one of an immigrant with Italian roots... yes, some Catholics have caught the reference... however, if today you want to call me Floriana, why not... I love flowers. But you still haven't said yours..."

"A name like many. [I'll tell it to you, and then you'll do as I have: change it](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#itellittoyou). I'll give you one that's good. As a kid I was called [Eta Beta](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#etabeta) because I would keep everything in my pocket: string, stones, nails, snails, slingshots, pens..."

"I like Eta Beta. Let's leave it at that."

"It hasn't been used in some time," he said with a certain sadness.
<!-- Page 83 -->

"And we fish it out of your memory: Eta Beta. And what about Daniel's? Do we change that also?"

Daniel protested, while Floriana approached the roundabout at the entrance to Alba, where the sun lit up the giant truffle slicer lying on the grass as the true emblem of the city, a reference stronger than crosses, crowns, laurels, or towers. 

"*Daniel* suits him," said Eta Beta, pleased. "Leave him as Daniel."

Floriana turned onto the autostrada towards Cuneo, through a countryside that couldn't breathe, between one warehouse and the other, with the most diverse architectures and colors, next to one another: in front of Monviso, harsh and gray, cutting into a soft blue, floating in the light. 

Daniel felt refreshed, he had taken off his jacket and rolled up his sleeves, had asked to open the vent and was now smoking a cigarette, holding it alongside the glass. Eta Beta was wrapped in his coat, and had pulled from his pocket a CD by Dean Martin, *That's Amore*, begging Floriana to let him listen to it. He asked her to skip immediately to his favorite song, number sixteen, *Return to Me*. Really, also number eighteen, *Under the Bridge of Paris*, where dreams come true, touched his heart, but in those days, in the weeks there, it was, he repeated, *Return to Me* that had him pining, especially when Dean sang "Return to me, I love you my dear, only you, only you, only you, my heart..." in an Italian submerged in a torrent of violins and breaths of harmonica. Never mind that he called *la bella mia* Anzoloni instead of Angiolina. Anyway, he said, he knew what name to give to Anzoloni-Angiolina.

Floriana started the CD and let him listen in silence. Then, while the player moved to the first song, the swaying dance, *That's Amore*, she asked, "An unhappy love?"

"Alas, yes. Like all loves that don't end in attachment, routine. A true love, one that generates nostalgia and regret."
<!-- Page 84 -->

"I don't want to hear about it," Daniel moaned.

"You have no cause for it, Daniel," said Eta Beta, "You, and blessed you, but also bad for you, look back on a love, or to more accurately put it, a union, without regrets. And in front of you, who knows, the future is wide open. But not for me, for me it closed like a guillotine, or to not be so dramatic, like a gate, just a few weeks ago. And with great, and I think unique, suffering."

"What do you mean, my future is open?" asked Daniel.

"You're waiting, like me," said Floriana in a low voice, but not low enough to avoid being heard by her two travel companions.

"You're not here to pick out Italian wines?" asked Daniel.

"And you, then?" retorted Eta Beta. "You weren't here to teach a wine tasting class? And look at the story you've been caught in."

Daniel defended himself weakly, saying: "It wasn't up to me..."

"We always bear the guilt when falling in love," said Eta Beta, in a tone that didn't allow a reply. "Reread Stendhal, or Barthes, if you prefer. In this case, Barthes, if you haven't read him, if you would permit me to advise our kind driver, Floriana."

Daniel caught a tone of ambiguity Eta Beta's voice, but couldn't decipher it. He hadn't read Barthes, and of Stendhal he had distant memories from school.

"[They will lower your immune system](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#theywilllower). Maybe because you are less vigilant. Maybe it's the last thing you'd expect while already searing on the grill of love. The fact is that we foolishly think we're in paradise. But we must still ask ourselves how this could happen. And for answers, there are a thousand, and none."
<!-- Page 85 -->

Eta Beta looked out of the comfortable car: he saw a light frost covering the countryside, the last persimmon fruit saved from the birds, shining with its already meager pulp. There was abundant snow in the mountains. 

"We fall in love with self-gratification. You decide, and that's that. It's a cycle, varying depending on the subject. We aren't like the rose or parsley, which in every season are forced to depart, shedding their leaves and buds. We follow a personal rhythm, we are singularly human. Do you think, Floriana, that at my age I might still fall in love?"

"There's no age limit," said Floriana, while Dean Martin came back to sing *Return to Me*.

"They say that, you say that, I say that. Love always has the flavor of an irrational fight between adolescents. Don't you think that there's something truly strange in this?"

"Love is youth," Floriana tried to say, looking at the sides of the road, where cows and horses lazed in the shade of mulberry and walnut trees.

"It's not a category, youthfulness, that can be saved from the anomaly, from the disease that it is, from the state of alteration that it causes. You imagine a world completely in love. Then what?"

"Maybe it would be our salvation," said Daniel, "No more war, no more aggression. Only peace and serenity."

"Really, because the woman who's with me doesn't want someone else? And I, I can't be wanted, perhaps without knowing it, or not fully knowing it, by someone else? And according to Daniel, everyone would be peaceful and without conflicts between happiness and delusion?"
<br/><br/><br/>

Should they all go to Sorrento, as suggested by Dean in song 14? 

They had come to the fatal bridge of suicides in Cuneo, and the rocky embrace of the Bisalta mountain and the lower Alps.
<!-- Page 86 -->

"It's almost noon," said Eta Beta, "I suggest a short stop in homage to our kind host. We could eat two [marron glac&eacute;](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#marronglace) from Arion and two small sandwiches from Sillano. I know, the order should be reversed. But in this instance it's also like love: first the sweet, then the savory."

They came out onto Piazza Galimberti, and Eta Beta told her to pull over and stop. 

The first stop was a half disappointment. On the threshold of summer, Arione no longer made marron glac&eacute;, and the Droneresi had run out of it because of the plentiful supply of tourists in transit to Tenda in the Alps. It went better at Sillano, where the small sandwiches of butter and anchovies, peppers and artichokes, salami and butter, and [insalata russa](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#insalatarussa), had just been made and placed, fresh and fragrant, on the shelves of the counter.

Eta Beta invited them to take a table, but not to carry a [fixed assortment](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cabaret) of sandwiches to it: it was better to get up and serve yourself, because the mouthwatering goodness of the morsels increased when choosing it from among its neighbors.

Floriana and Daniel, who continued to check his watch, accepted the invitation to the table and ordered drinks only: an iced tea and a tomato juice. Eta Beta ordered a sparking Berlucchi and dived into the miraculous catch. 

"Love brings hunger," Floriana suggested.

"When it ends, for compensation, more than when it begins. When it begins, you desire to eat the beloved, right?" 

Floriana agreed with that. She asked "A great love?"

"How to measure it against what came before? The last, certainly. And you?"

"I escaped a recent disappointment. But I also don't know how to measure it against what came previously, and above all with those that I hope will come. Even if now I'm not so sure, and I just have to trust in the probability calculation that my age gives me."
<!-- Page 87 -->

"Love is an enzyme that we carry inside us," Daniel said, shaking his head and gulping down a tuna and artichoke sandwich.

"Sure, an enzyme that's shocked my body."

"Was she very beautiful, your beloved?" asked Floriana.

Eta Beta nodded and asked in return: "And yours?"

Floriana nodded with a proud look that especially affected Daniel, [who suppressed a question forming on his lips](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#fiordilabbra).

"Yes, she was very beautiful," continued Eta Beta. "Or perhaps more interesting than beautiful. Her profile was very beautiful, seen from the right, and interesting from the front, overall. I looked at it a lot, her profile. When she went driving, I often tried to go in the car with her. So I could look at her for a long time. She told me that I didn't say much. But I couldn't do both things, and for me it was essential that I look at her."

"And how was the right side of her face?" asked Daniel, interested.

"How was it?" asked Eta Beta rhetorically, who meanwhile had ordered the Russian Viola cheese. "It was like the profile of a tender and gentle fish. Majestic, I would say. Like certain groupers of the deep. Or like that of an iguana on Darwin's island, primordial, mysterious. A look which has seen, as they say, the dawn of time, a light on a world still indistinct." 

Floriana and Daniel drank and were silent. Customers passing their table looked curiously at the trio, and especially the man wrapped in his blue coat and red scarf, intent on drinking his steaming tea.

"It would be better if we get going, to stay on time," said Eta Beta, rising.

"Yes, it will calm me down," echoed Daniel.

"It gets so difficult when it comes to time," said Floriana.
<!-- Page 88 -->

"It's so rare that our time coincides with that of another," added Eta Beta.

"Especially when one is in love," commented Floriana.

"And the other isn't. Or is a little late. When one still is, and the other isn't anymore. Is this what you're talking about, Floriana?"

Eta Beta went to pay and they left under the shaded arcades of Corso Torino, got in the car, and took the road to Limone.

"Times of love rarely coincide," continued Eta Beta. "When you have the good fortune, or should I say the miracle, of them happening together, at the start, you must not stand there and think twice: you go..."

"Did that also happen to you this time?"

Eta Beta nodded. "It happened like that, and we were both helped by experience. We were not, as they say, [spring chickens](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#diprimopelo)."

Floriana didn't pick up the joke, and Daniel didn't hear it, he was absorbed in looking at the plains beside the road, and by the thought that soon he would meet his daughter. How would she react to this strange group? He thought that these who would be meeting her were certainly not ordinary people.

"When and where did it happen?" asked Floriana.

"Let me tell it like a story of which I was an involuntary witness, or, if you prefer, a confidant. Tolerate and forgive the artifice, but my soul and body are still wounded."

"Would replaying *That's Amore* help?" asked Floriana. Eta Beta didn't respond, he was lying in the backseat pulling the red scarf over his head, and raising the lapels of his coat to cover his face. He began his story with a gentle, monotonous, voice:

"It was September, the end of September. It wasn't cold like now, when their story has faded, or so it seemed, because a lover's hope is as hard as a diamond, it was late September when everything began."
<!-- Page 89 -->

"Can I interrupt the story if there's something I don't catch?" asked Floriana, without getting an answer.
<br/><br/><br/>

"It was a warm September, as there are in certain Riviera Septembers of soft light, after a summer that wasn't excessively hot. A light like Monet's seas, for instance, those on the seafronts of Nice and Cannes.

"Giacomo, let me call him Giacomo, had gone to hear a concert in Menton, there was a young Indian pianist, Nirmala Khira, who performed the Goldberg Variations. In the program there was the Little Fugue, Alla Breve, the Quodlibet, the Overture, and other wonders of Bach which, in the memory and in the art of listening, Giacomo linked to the incomparable Glenn Gould.

"It was mid-afternoon, an orange sunset wept on the rocks of the Balzi Rossi below, softening and moving them like slow waves.

"Giacomo had climbed up to the church square with some friends. He was greeted as he entered, perhaps out of courtesy, or because he had a folding chair and around his neck a badge for the Friends of Music, by a young woman in pants and a sweater. She had long hair down to her shoulders, smooth, [blonde like a Titian](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#tiziani). But perhaps it was *he* who greeted her, and what followed seems to confirm it, because towards that feminine silhouette against the wall, he felt something ineffable, a brilliant attraction, an infinite weakness, he felt that as he looked.

"They sat in the middle of the square and listened to the concert, which lasted, with significant technical support, for over an hour. Then, after loud and generous applause, the audience dispersed into the narrow streets of Menton, and Giacomo and his friends found themselves with some of the organizers and the Indian pianist. They were going to eat trout almondine in Gorbio. Why not join them? Giacomo, though he considered trout taboo, accepted the invitation on behalf of his friends. He thought that at that altitude they still made rabbit with olives and that a tomato salad was not to be missed.
<!-- Page 90 -->

"At the entrance to Gorbia there still lived a great elm that the village said was more than 500 years old, its trunk wrinkled and hollow, sprouting high green branches, and the old men sat in the shade smoking pipes and playing [belote](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#belote).

"They had reservations at [*Leone D'Oro*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#leonedoro) and Giacomo found himself sitting between Nirmala Khira and the woman whom someone had called Francesca. With Khira they spoke about Glenn Gould's two sweaters, about microphones and the recording of the nocturnes, about piano stools and [that nose among the keys of the Steinway](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thatnose); they spoke of cold and heat, then Giacomo was again sucked into the conversations that Francesca addressed to her neighbors, commenting on the cycle of concerts, praise for the market in Menton, clarifications of the names of the remote villages. Conversations of the occasion that Giacomo never managed to cement in his memory. In it remained, instead, her request for a cigarette, immediately after saying, though no one had asked her, that she had stopped smoking for some time, and the consumption of the same, outside the restaurant, together and silent: light puffs, lips timid on the filter of the Philip Morris, so it would last longer in the unexpected intimacy of the Gorbio piazza, now immersed in the dark, deserted.

"It was their first encounter, then the cigarette was finished. They went back in and got lost between the dessert and well-wishing, one last toast to the hands of Nirmala Khira and his future concerts, the exchange of business cards.

"The next day Giacomo had to go back to M., the city in which he lived. He returned to the office, sat at his desk, lit the first cigarette of the day and immediately the smoke drew a feminine silhouette that he associated with the image of Francesca, leaning against the window of the *Leone D'Oro*. Even in the scent of the cigarette he thought he recognized the smell of lemon flowers. He touched his pocket, thinking that there had been at the table an amnesia about the time duration of Gould's Alla Breve. Francesca has said 40 seconds, he 42, and Khira 41. He found Francesca's business card.

<!-- Page 91 -->

"Giacomo phoned his friend Gariazzo at the store and asked if he could check the time of Alla Breve performed by Gould. Of course, Khira was right, it was 41. He thanked the friend and remained smoking and turning over the business card with Francesca's phone and e-mail. Should he call her, or write to her? He decided to write to tell her that they'd both been wrong, by a second, not so much in absolute terms, but enough for so short a performance."
<br/> <br/> <br/>

"We've reached San Dalmazzo," interrupted Daniel, who had seemed to have fallen asleep, "My grandfather used to come here to buy meat and snails. He'd stay for one night and one morning. At home they thought he had a female distraction, and when he returned my grandmother used to say that she knew about the *crava*, about the goat, and that even the meat smelled of goat, and that it was useless to go such a long way, and take so much time, when you could buy it in France, where it was better. My grandfather countered that the snails of San Dalmazzo were unique. But my grandmother didn't give up, she shrugged her shoulders and said that [she didn't want the snails to suffer](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#snailssuffer)."

Eta Beta snorted in annoyance, glanced at the narrow road between the reddish walls of the village's plain houses. He wanted to revisit the smell of the cigarette that hung, electrifyingly, in Giacomo's office. 
<!-- Page 92 -->

"Francesca didn't seem to expect that e-mail. She responded to him immediately, telling him that Sunday she had gone swimming in her underwear, she and two of her friends, in the [Bay of Angels](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#bayofangels). Then, [underwear up to the waist](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#slipallacintura), they had taken the Le Corbusier evening walk, and then had returned by car to Menton. Giacomo, alas how naively, was impressed by the self-assurance he considered unusual in a frequenter of classical concerts. [He responded jokingly](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cazzeggiando), undecided whether to deal with the problem of the soaked underwear and its hanging on her waist, then decided to gloss over it and expatiated on the temperature of the water at the end of September and on the many hang gliders that arrived like bats on the beach, gliding over the open newspapers and between the legs of the last bathers.

"Days passed and they continued to write to each other, those from her telling of small, sometimes insignificant, everyday events, facts about problems at work &ndash; Francesca was an interior designer &ndash; moments of free time that she would spend with her children (she had two: a little boy and a girl, ages 7 and 14), with her aged father, walking the hills. He knew the names of the places and the flowers that were so familiar to him that he felt at home.

"Giacomo didn't ask, she told him that she was separated, she had settled a relationship that had dragged on for too long at the beginning of that September, and now found herself with two children to share with her ex-husband.

"One morning, they had now spent a couple of weeks on their daily correspondence, Giacomo wrote 'It's raining, can I use the familiar *tu*?' She replied that she failed to understand the connection, but that it was fine. And Giacomo began to use the familiar with her, and she did with him. Moreover, the tone of their more or less short letters had become more than friendly, I would say affectionate, almost flirtatious. Francesca told him that she had a nickname, Cisca, and often she signed her letters with many small *k*s that stood for *kisses*, [of course there were many and a few possibly had the taste of her lips on them](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#piuerano), [but whenever there was one, and just one *k*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#malevolte), Giacomo would stop and stare at the letter as if it were an island of attainable happiness. It was enough to take the plunge and swim.

"And it was she who invited him to plunge [one afternoon, at the end of the evening](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#unpomeriggio), by writing 'Where will you take me Saturday night?' and with the answer 'Wherever you would like,' Giocomo committed the first, irreparable, [or as he had long continued to judge it, mistake](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ocosilungamente). She suggested a remote town, right on the border between Italy and France, a place that Giocomo knew well, a place for gourmets that he had visited as a boy, with friends. It was a restaurant enclosed in the valley, beyond Carletti, there for more than fifty years, with the same menu: rabbit, goat and beans, [belurini flowers](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#belurini) and stuffed onion, in the winter, artichoke torte, at Easter, vegetable torte. How could Francesca have known that place?"
