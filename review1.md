Roughly translated from [http://www.saporidielisa.it/2011/12/di-cibo-e-di-libri-di-viole-e.html].

This time, more than "food and books," we should say "wine and books."

Daniel Lorenzi is a French sommelier who is staying for a few days in Alba. He is in the Langhe so that he can give a wine tasting course on the "Greats of France" at the *Tastevin* wine bar. He is an old-style sommelier who understands the decadence of his profession: now it is pure glitz, and there are few that know and really love wine-making. He, on the contrary, is a great connoisseur of wine. He knows it very well and above all loves those of the Langhe.

Between the lectures and visiting other places and landscapes, readers can completely immerse themselves in the typical atmosphere of the Langhe. And in these travels, one meets various personalities, real "human portraits," each with their own character, their own role in the story and their involvement in (or disruption of) in the life of our sommelier.

Amalia, owner, with her brother Giulio, of the *Tastevin* wine bar and the Ginotta farm; Luciano, the driver carrying the French taster up and down the Langhe; Eta Beta, the inscrutable writer; Baravalle, the upstart peasant who, in a game of cards, wins half of Ginotta from Giulio.

All these characters, however, revolve around the undisputed star of the novel: the wine, with its odors and colors.

A very interesting novel for wine lovers and for those who want to discover something about the Langhe (which, by the way, is my homeland :-)). An unusual book for Orengo, who usually writes about his beloved region, Liguria.

The plot is simple, as simple as an authentic love for the land and the value of roots and memories. As simple as the overall feel of a good wine should be, and not distorted by the exaggerated gestures and buzzwords of some fake sommelier.

I quote a passage, in my opinion very evocative, to let you "taste" the novel and inspire you to read it, because it truly deserves it and you can "drink" it all in one gulp:

*Daniel looked at the glass: another prominent wine. From its color, Daniel thought it also came from Nebbiolo, the color was again garnet red with sparkles of sunset, when the sun, the color of a squeezed orange, goes to die between one hill and the next, as if it were dancing the tango with a gay melancholy.*
