He helped her get up and, following her directions, crossed the small courtyard of the Tastevin, and accompanied her up a narrow staircase to the first floor. He asked if he could do something. Amalia wasn't steady on her legs, that glass must have been the last of many. They were in a living room furnished with designer furniture, armchairs of leather and chrome, white sofas, photographs of pink beaches and crystal blue seas.

"Leave me alone..." she said to him, now with a rough tone, her hands covering her face. 

Daniel left, finding Flop at the bottom of the stairs, waiting. He retraced his steps on Via Maestro with anxiety, he couldn't feel any part of it, and the street seemed inclined underneath his feet. He leaned against the doorjamb of a shop to catch his breath, and only after a moment was he able to decipher the words of a female voice asking him if he was unwell. He focused on the Asian face surrounded by a cascade of smooth black hair. It was Maria.

"Not feeling well?"

Daniel tried to smile at her. He took a deep breath to dispel the nagging sense of vertigo that engulfed his head.

"I have a car here, around the corner. Rest on my arm."

Daniel pulled away from the door frame, took her arm, and followed her. In a few meters, they reached the car. She opened the door for him, and Daniel sank into the seat.

"Feel better?"

"A heat stroke...age...the pressure..."

Maria laughed.

"You're not my grandfather... he can say it... he's 86..."

"Maybe I could use a bit of fresh air... do you know how to go up into the hills?"

"I have GPS, tell me the name of the town..."

Daniel laughed, he said "La Morra."

Maria started the engine, typed the name into the small computer, and left.

"Does this happen often?" she asked.

"No... perhaps it's the heat... or a bit of stress... I need a little vacation also..."

"You're working?"

They looked at each other and laughed.

"Of course... it doesn't seem like it, and it doesn't seem like it to me either, but it is."

Maria drove easily on the narrow curves of the hills. 

"How did you get into your profession?"

Daniel looked at her, it was one of those simple questions that people no longer asked him, as if his job were now normal, one of many, the spoils of wealth, of the new etiquette that provided, for a growing audience, the approach to knowing how to drink well.

"My grandfather was a stationmaster, I had to choose between train fumes and the smells of the little property we had. I was undecided until I was 20. I liked the trains, the tracks laid out in front of the station, the smell of grease and stones and the blackened railroad ties. Then I chose the countryside, the vineyard, I was attracted by the scents of the herbs. We had a beautiful vineyard of white grapes, I began to pursue it, to make wine in the cooperative. I had a good nose, a good palate, I could smell the aromas, knew how to separate them. I grew up in restaurants and vineyards. They said I was good at it, the locals that wanted to expand their wine cellars called me and I went, moving to different regions of France, following the paths of the great wines, half the time in the hall and in the cellar, and the other half in the vineyards."

He felt better, he had opened the window and the air got fresher, the hills were in the shadows and the sun was about to touch the peak of Monviso. Maria had listened to him attentively, slowing her speed. Daniel thought that he'd never been able to explain to Nicole why he chose his job, that he had never found the easy way, the few words to capture the sense of his life. 

"Should I stop here?"

They were in a parking lot below the town. They set out on the short climb and emerged on an overlook that offered a beautiful view of the hills and the small Alps in the distance.

"Should we stay and eat?" Daniel asked, indicating a restaurant on the piazza, then, immediately feeling embarrassed, added quickly, "Or do you have other plans, Maria?"

"Sounds good to me."

They sat near the window and toasted with a Serafino, lightly *frizzante*. Maria said that she'd like to toast *cin cin*  to Piedmont, and to their meeting, and Daniel returned the kindness by saying that he hoped she would have a good trip. 

They ate *vitello tonnato* and cold peppers with a small *bagna cauda*, then she wanted to try the tagliolini with meat ragu and rabbit with peppers. She ate with enjoyment, drinking in small sips. 

"Dolcetto, right?" she asked. Whose is it? 

"Chionetti, from Dogliani," answered Daniel.

"Dogliani is important. We've been there, they have a beautiful cemetery... eclectic architecture... but the wineries are also important, right?" 

<!-- Page 61 -->

Daniel nodded. He felt much better, although in the corner of his head and in his gut, the accusations of Giulio still burned; he hadn't wanted to force anyone against their will, and the words of Amalia, although alcohol induced, were harsh.

Her heard Maria's voice asking him "Are you married?" Daniel nodded.

"Didn't you take your vows in France?" she asked, smiling mischievously.

"We're separated."

"I'm sorry," said Maria as she stopped smiling. "I was being indiscreet. Excuse me. Do you have children?"

"A girl, a few years younger than you." 

"Is she a student?"

Daniel thought about whether to change the subject or to let it go on. At times, he wanted to drink wine without tasting it, without feeling anything but its liquidity, its flow down the throat, as naturally as looking out to the sea.

A cheese course arrived, small slivers of goat cheese, triangles of fresh toma.

"She doesn't do anything. She argues with me and with her mother. Runs away, disappears."

Maria stopped eating. Daniel continued: "It's not an interesting story. It's a banal story. In and out of clinics and detox centers like thousands, or should I say millions, of others of her generation. At times, it seems like she's coming out of it, then she relapses and hell begins again."

"How long has this been going on?" asked Maria. 

"Three years... three long years that have wrecked our marriage and created a thousand difficulties at work for my wife and me. There are more noble causes to ruin your life and the lives of others, don't you think? Or perhaps not. Who knows, would it be better to be a guerrilla in the southern hemisphere somewhere? Or a volunteer in one of those humanitarian organizations. Although I'd prefer to see her teaching in any school in Paris."

<!-- Page 63 -->

Maria let Daniel pour his heart out. Then she said, "We've all gone close to that hell, and most times it was because we didn't accept ourselves, we covered our diversity with simple, common, clothes. Have you ever thought that, Daniel?"

The server arrived with a cart of digestifs. He suggested a Barolo Chinato and an ice. And while Maria said that she would prefer a limoncello, Daniel reflected on her words. What did they mean?

"You don't know how to accept that? I think that few people are satisfied with themselves, perhaps the dull, and saints and martyrs. But we, mere mortals, are destined to have our lives follow a normal path."

"From day to day, yes, but what we really are, or what we can possibly become, is fundamentally decided by us when we're young. Haven't you done that also? There are easier choices, almost natural, spontaneous, and others that require us to change our skin. And if we don't have the strength to do it, and we don't have outside help, there is dissonance, and we try to jump."

"What does all this have to do with my daughter?" Daniel asked apprehensively.

"Do you know your daughter, Daniel?"

Daniel took his time, finished his Barolo Chinato. 

"To respond with the obvious, Maria, it's always difficult to know what's right next to you, and perhaps with your children it's twice as difficult."

"Perhaps your daughter isn't comfortable in her body..."

That's what Marc had said also, to he and Laurencine. But what he meant wasn't so clear.

Maria knew that he was troubled. She said, "I also wasn't very comfortable with my body. I suffered for years."

Daniel looked at her, incredulous. She was very beautiful, with a firm body, not skinny: he remembered the first night at the *Tastevin*, when he thought she was a mannequin. 
<!-- Page 64 -->

"Maria, what was wrong with your body?"

"It wasn't mine, it wasn't that of a girl that I wanted. I didn't want to be a girl, I didn't want to grow breasts. I didn't want to menstruate. I wanted to be like my brothers. Do you understand, Daniel?"

The bill arrived, Daniel had given his credit card and they'd come out upon a night of harvest stars, they were so low and full of light. They started in silence towards the car. Maria had taken Daniel's arms. She said, with a slight smile, shyly "Have I upset you?"

Daniel said that all true confessions create disorientation, constitute a new way of seeing, a view marked by vertigo.

"Like those that you had this evening?" Maria asked.

They arrived at the car and Daniel asked to drive. The roads would distract him. They descended slowly, in silence, among the stars that seemed stuck on the stakes in the vineyards and seemed to leave red spots in the darkness. 

He parked in front of the *Hotel Cavalieri* and said he'd like to take a short walk. Maria asked if she would see him again, she was here two more days, and she wanted to go meet Bartolo Mascarello. Daniel said he was staying at the *Savona*, and would perhaps be gone for a day: he had to pick up his daughter at the airport in Nice.

"If you don't know how to get there, let me know, Daniel..." [she said with a slight bow and, it seemed to him, an ironic nod of her head](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#shesaidwith).

Daniel answered her with a *ciao* and he walked along the main road, behind anonymous buildings that blocked the view of the towers illuminating the city. He began to hear a strange agitation in the arcades, just before the hotel: in small groups, men were arguing heatedly, something must have happened, he heard jeers and curses. He climbed the steps of the *Savona* and went into the hotel. In the lobby, men in shirt sleeves were toasting with bottles of Spumanti, their jackets on the floor, someone sang, men who were about 40, some of them dancing on the tables. There was a radio playing music at full volume, on an empty table a deck of cards was scattered on a green tablecloth.
<!-- Page 65 -->

Daniel looked toward the reception counter, there was Silvio, with a gloomy face. 

"What are they celebrating?" asked Daniel with a half-smile, putting on an air of annoyance.

"Giulo bet his share of Ginotta at poker. And lost..."

"What?"

"He put it up for two hours and finally he succeeded," Silvio said angrily, "after he lost it, he recovered twice, but finally was able to leave it permanently on the table. The person dancing up there is the new owner, Baravalle."

Daniel asked for something strong to drink, headed towards the private room, entered the small office, and sat down at the desk. He was hot, he took off his jacket while Silvio came in with a bottle of whiskey, two glasses, and a cup of ice. He poured the liquor and asked if Daniel wanted some ice. Daniel shook his head, and asked, "Why did he do it?"

Silvio sat at the head of the desk, drank some whiskey, and said, "He wasn't even drunk, he only seemed angry, very angry. He came in at 7 and called Baravalle on the phone." 

"Who is Baravalle?" asked Daniel, drinking his whiskey in small sips.

<!-- Page 66 -->

A winemaker, wines of average quality, that are exported wholesale to Germany. One who knows business. He's been aiming for Ginotta for years, and not just that. He has lands bordering it.

"What do you mean, 'not just'?"

Silvio smiled, he filled his glass halfway and filled Daniel's to the brim. 

"To get that land he's tried to marry Amalia, or maybe he really wanted to... who knows. The fact is that regarding Ginotta, or maybe both of them, he's never given up. And now that fool Giulio has given him the knife by the handle. Why? I'd like to know myself."

Daniel perhaps sensed the reason intuitively, but tried to dismiss it as an irrational act, unthinkable, a latent disease, never declared, or declared so softly as to seem innocuous. And instead, the jealousy of that morbid bond had exploded with destructive force. The euphoria of the loss of Ginotta and the punishment of Amalia would be replaced, now, with a devastating sense of guilt.

"Where's Giulio now?"

"He's gone, he got in his car and left," said Silvio, shrugging his shoulders.

"Has Amalia been warned?"

Silvio shrugged his shoulders again.

"[It would seem strange that no one would have bothered to give her the good news](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#itwouldseem)..."
