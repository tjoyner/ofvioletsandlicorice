Daniel left the Savona after going up to his room to get Flop. He passed by the *Tastevin* but found it closed. He went in through the courtyard door to Amalia's apartment to find out whether she had heard the harsh news. The chairs in the lounge were overturned, the pictures were off the walls, lying on the ground with the glass broken. Amalia must have been in a terrible rage.

Daniel righted a few chairs, kicking some shards of glass against the wall, holding Flop who was nervously sniffing the air. 

Where could Amalia be? There was just one place she could have gone to for refuge: Ginotta. He looked at the time. It was midnight: too late to telephone Luciano and ask him to take him to the farm? 

He decided to walk there, which wouldn't take more than half an hour. He cut across Piazza Rossetti, went past the cathedral and headed towards Altavilla, with Flop following him, keeping to the side of the road. Occasional cars climbed up, illuminating the road and the vineyards, hitting the cement poles and transforming parts of the vineyard into cemeteries. They also diminished the stars, swallowed by a darkness made of cobalt. 

He looked for the gap between the hazelnut trees: Flop found it, and Daniel went up the slope towards the Ginotta farmstead. He was sweating and short of breath. He stopped to calm his breathing near the well. The farmhouse was plunged in darkness, with no light filtering through the windows, but the door was ajar.  Trying not to make noise, Daniel climbed the uneven steps of the entrance, squinting into the kitchen. It was too dark not to stumble into a chair or a cupboard, not to bang against a table. Daniel checked his pocket, he had some matches. He lit one and tried to light up the room. The flame burnt down almost immediately to his fingertips. He cursed under this breath and lit a second. Moving towards the center of the room, he saw her. 
<!-- Page 68 -->

Amalia was curled up on a beat-up sofa and seemed to be asleep. Daniel approached her, she was dressed as when he'd left her, her hair disheveled and her face drawn. He took a tablecloth from the table, [scattering a cloud of dust that tinted the space around them gray](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#scattering), and spread it gently on her body, which reacted with a short tremor and with what sounded like a sob.

Daniel held his breath in fear of waking her up, but Amalia's body didn't make any other movements, nor was there any sound from her mouth except a restless and contorted breath. He backed up towards the stairs, where Flop stood, and wondered if he should go back to the hotel or if would be better to remain there, waiting for her to wake up. He sat on the steps, leaned back against the staircase wall, and drew Flop against his stomach. There weren't many hours until dawn, and then it would be sunrise. He wished it weren't so soon. 
<br/> <br/> <br/> 
When he awoke there were screams. They came from the farmhouse and from the courtyard, mingled with the barking of Flop, who ran down the stairs. Daniel felt back pain and cramps in his legs. He rubbed his face and remembered where he was, and immediately recognized the voice of Amalia shouting: "Get out of my house, Go!"

And another voice answered: "Your half, Amalia!"

"What you did to my brother doesn't count!"

"It counts, oh it counts: he has regularly gambled half the farm. In front of witnesses, Amalia. Resign yourself."

Daniel got up from the step and went down the stairs. That arrogant voice had to be Baravalle. He came out into the yard and saw him. He was fiddling with a fence that stretched halfway across the yard. Daniel took a few steps toward him and heard the irritated voice of Amalia ask him: "And what are you doing here?"

Daniel turned and looked up at the window. He then saw a large white stripe running from the ground to the roof of the farmhouse, dividing it in two. Without answering Amalia, he again advanced towards Baravalle, who seemed surprised by his presence.

"What are you doing here?" Daniel asked.

Baravalle looked at him with annoyance, continuing to play with the metal fence.

"I'm on mine. Since yesterday evening, this farm is half mine &ndash; land, vineyard, and walls. Who are you?"

He went over to meet him, coming out of the patch of light that had hit him in the face. He seemed to recognize him, and said with contempt, "Ah, you're the sommelier from Paris, who's come to teach us how to drink wine."

Daniel stopped, struck by his aggressiveness. He said: "Go away, and take away that fence."

"What does this have to do with you? What are you doing here?"

Amalia's voice hit him, along with Baravalle's laughter, like a punch in the stomach. A taste of bitter almonds washed over his palate, drying his throat. He didn't know how to respond. He looked around. He looked at the yard, where Baravalle continued to stare menacingly. He turned his eyes toward Amalia, who was leaning against the window sill, with a menacing look toward them both.

Daniel turned his back to the farm, called Flop, and went down the slope to the hazelnut grove, wondering what he had to do, after all, with the story there. 
<br/> <br/> <br/>

He returned to the hotel. Silvio wasn't behind the counter, so he took the key and went up to his room. He sat on the bed, with Flop at his feet, and wondered what he should do. It was only two days until Nicole arrived. Should he stop her, or pack his bags and from Nice take her to visit Provence? He could rent a car and stay out for a week, then go up to Paris or back to Nice. The thought of being in the company of his daughter, traveling without anyone else present, disturbed him. He couldn't cancel the meeting with Nicole, [he wouldn't be forgiven for it, and they'd never excuse him](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#hewouldntbeforgiven). He took his suitcase from the closet and began to pack, but halfway through he was overcome with fatigue in the neck and shoulders. He lay down on the bed and forced himself to sleep.
<br/> <br/> <br/>

He was awakened by the ringing telephone. It was Silvio, who told him that Amalia was there and that she wanted to talk to him.

"Put her through," he said, and he heard an awkward silence.

"She's here..."

This time it was Daniel who felt awkward: "I'll be down in a minute."

"She says she wants to come up..."

Daniel looked at the room, it was neat enough, and he said she could come up. Then he opened a window and put on his shoes. He opened the door before Amalia knocked. For a moment, they remained still, looking at each other. She had changed. She had on a pair of black pants and a white jacket over a violet blouse. She wore a small string of pearls around her neck. Daniel pointed to the only chair in the room. While going to sit down, dodging Flop, who had decided to take refuge in the bathroom, Amalia said, "So now you know..."

<!-- Page 71 -->

Daniel nodded.

"I was at the notary. It's all official, there's a piece of paper, there are witnesses: that wretch of my brother has lost half of our farm. I said to the notary that I would buy it back, to tell Baravalle to name his price. It came to nothing: he had told him that he'd like to buy the other half from me right away. It was clear to me that Baravalle still wanted the land of Ginotta."

She pressed her face between her hands. 

"And now he has half of it, and my brother has disappeared..."
<br/> <br/> <br/>

Daniel reached his hand towards her head, then stopped. He let her vent.

"I didn't notice until later his morbid attachment to me. It's partly my fault, apart from a sister I was also mother and father. I had guilty feelings also: if he was alone in the world it was my fault. And through the years it got worse, he's never been able to bear having another male presence around. We quarreled, he tried to destroy my every possible relationship. I existed only for him. And I, because of fatigue, and also for a quiet life, had finally adapted to the situation, tacitly asking in return that he let me decide the fate of Ginotta."

Amalia took a handkerchief from her jacket pocket, wiped away her tears, and blew her nose quietly. Then, looking him straight in the eye, she added, "Like an animal, he sensed that you could be a problem. He sensed that your presence could change his, our life, whether a lot or a little isn't important. He felt a change, maybe that night when I kissed you he followed us, I don't know... I know that I, too, when I saw you, felt something that would upset the balance of our lives. The feelings are hard to explain..."
<!-- Page 72 -->

Daniel sat on the bed. He thought that if he had quickly packed his suitcase and had left a couple of hours ago, he wouldn't have had to listen to this confession, return to this story. But no, he had stopped, he had slept, and now he was in it entirely.

He said: "First we'll look for your brother. That's what we need the most from you right now. Baravalle is too excited from his conquest to try to reason with."

He offered her his hand, she took it. Daniel held her close. Then he helped her up and they walked down the hall toward the stairs. Flop didn't follow.

He offered to drive, but she told him that driving would calm her down. He asked her if Giulio had friends, they could start with them. Amalia had already made a round of phone calls to the few that she could count, but none of them had followed the poker game, much less heard from him afterward.

"Does he frequent any bars in the area?" he asked.

"Not that I know of... we live so close together and yet know so little about each other, right Daniel?"

It was. And maybe it was a reaction to that convincing illusion of living in a transparent society that gives you the feeling of knowing everything about everyone, a defense against intrusiveness imposed by public behavior. We live a life on the edge of nakedness, and we defend ourselves by hiding it from each other, [not always more real or more artificial](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#notalwaysmore).

"Amalia, we're flying blind, there's no point... let me give it a try... you stop in at the *Tastevin*... maybe Giulio will phone there... maybe someone will stop by to tell you something."

Amalia reluctantly reversed gear and turned towards the cathedral.

"What will you do?"

"I may have someone who, with discretion, can help us."

<!-- Page 73 -->

He left her in front of the *Caffe Callisano* and went in to look for a telephone. He called Luciano and asked him if he were available, if he could come and get him. He waited for him, drinking a fresh orange and lemon juice. Luciano was aware of the poker game at the *Savona* the previous night and Giulio's subsequent disappearance. And when Daniel got into the car, he said, "Do you have any idea where to look for him? I imagine not. Should I try?" 

Daniel nodded. Luciano shook his head.

"What would you do, after fucking up like that? Go jump in a river, hide yourself, leave and put as many kilometers as possible between that bullshit and those who'll suffer and those who'll benefit. Or not?"

Daniel agreed.

"He hasn't thrown himself in the Tanaro, that's certain, he's too much of a coward. He could hide himself, but where? In some casino in the area, between Alba and Asti. Or get a ticket to who knows where, and good night, at least until he thinks it's time to return. Somewhere that's not far from his sister."

"He kept his relationships with importers of wines from South America. I don't know them, but Amalia certainly does."

"If he paid his bills on time, they'll keep their mouths shut. Don't ask Amalia for a list. There's a wine bar in Canale that has the same suppliers as the *Tastevin*. Let's go there."

They took the main road to Canale, entering Roero, where nature was more rugged, the hills were carved with deep, white gullies, and the vineyards thinned out in favor of peach and apple orchards.
<br/> <br/> <br/>

"When you called I was just sitting down to eat. Do you mind if I get a plate to eat? A couple of sliced meats and some cheese?"

They were seated at a table of the *Bicchier di Vino*, under the low arcades of the main street. 

The bar had large, empty tables and high shelving on the walls. The wines were categorized by region, four side shelves were stocked with [*Recommendations from the World*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#recommendationsfrom). On the back labels of those bottles they could look up the importer's address, but Luciano said there was no need. He asked Daniel if he'd also like a small plate and a glass of Roero, then he went to find the owner.
<!-- Page 74 -->

He returned with some slices of local salami, sausage from Bra, ham from Langhe, a bowl of sliced olives, pieces of aged Castelmagno cheese, and goat cheese from Val Varaita.

"They'll bring us wine. Also the list of importers."

Daniel realized he was hungry. He hadn't eaten since the previous evening. He took a piece of sausage and squashed it onto some bread. 

The owner arrived, a young boy, thin and tall, was with him. He put a beer and a glass of red wine on the table and handed a list of addresses to Luciano. He said: "These are the important ones."

He sat at the table and asked the boy to get him an iced tea. 

"So Giulio managed to succumb to Baravalle. That beast, that rascal. But I don't see that's it's over... that property is trouble... I don't see that it's over yet. Baravalle will stir up some shit... half the farm is not enough... who knows why, but I'll feel he'll take a false step."

"During the day he's a veterinarian," Luciano said to Daniel, "he also has a sixth sense..." The two men laughed, while Daniel pursued a thought that was yet unformed, distant. He took the list that Lovera &ndash; that's how Luciano had introduced him &ndash; had put on the table, and gave it a look. There were names and addresses from Merano, Genoa, Rovigo, and Trieste.

"Assuming that our hypothesis is correct, Genoa is the closest."

"To me, he's either drunk or in some hotel room around here. He's never gone anywhere other than Cuneo by himself..." said Lovera, "... do you want me to make a couple of phone calls? Perhaps between customer and supplier, there's more... let's call it... intimacy."

He laughed, then without waiting for a response took the slip of paper out of Daniel's hand and walked away. 

"He's a good guy, discreet."

They continued to eat, Luciano voraciously, Daniel distractedly. After 10 minutes, Lovera returned.

"I telephoned Ribotti in Genoa. He said that Giulio had called him. Ribotti said that he was very agitated. He asked him if he could do something, but Giulio didn't say anything else. He asked him if he was home because perhaps he might go to Genoa, but he hasn't heard anything more."

"Would you like to go down to Genoa? We could be there in two hours..."

"If you go, look in the Autostrada plazas. He could have stopped to sleep there..." said Lovera.

Daniel didn't know what choice to make. He said he'd like to make a phone call. Lovera took him into the office and indicated the telephone on the wall. He called Amalia. She was still upset, had no news from her brother, and the *Tastevin* was full of onlookers who watched her every move. She wanted to throw them all out and close. Daniel told here that they had telephoned a supplier in Genoa, and that Giulio might be going there.

"Are you going there?" Amalia had asked, in a tone that he hadn't heard before, almost pleading.

Daniel returned to the dining room and told Luciano that they would be going down to Genoa.
