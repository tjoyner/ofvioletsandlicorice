Perhaps more than anything else, *Di viole e liquirizia* is Nico Orengo's homage to the wine and cuisine of Piedmont. Here's what Daniel, the sommelier protagonist, eats and drinks in the novel. 

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
Large salad (*Daniel ate the salad with pleasure, appreciating the radish and green pepper, tender carrots, salty capers, small black olives, valerian and endive, cucumber and lettuce heart. He discarded the garlic clove, but appreciated its scent, sweet and dry.*)  
Non-carbonated mineral water

Sip of Chardonnay (*[He] barely wet his lips. "Wouldn't it have been better to offer an Arneis, a Favorita, or a Blang&egrave; from this area?"*)

Mineral water (*"Don't worry, it's just a San Bernardo."*)

Vanilla gelato (*[He] asked for a vanilla cone, so as not to disappoint the boy behind the counter, who had offered him 4 or 5 samples.*)

Favorita and Freisa (*[He] asked the guests to blindfold themselves with their napkins. He'd have them taste a wine, and then ask if they had drunk a white or a red.*)  
Ratti Dolcetto (*...a good young Dolcetto in a dirty bottle with cobwebs*)  
Battaglino Dolcetto (*...a more modest Dolcetto from Battaglino in a clean bottle*)  
Ceretto Blang&egrave; (*Daniel had put the same wine in two unlabelled bottles*)  

Gin and tonic, light (*"The hard liquors don't ruin your palate?" "80% of the time I taste with my nose. With this potato, see?"*)

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
Levi grappa (*It had felt like young acacia thorns, and now his throat burned. Or perhaps it burned simply because he had drunk too much of it.*)

Coffee (strong) (*"I never drink it before tasting wine..."*)

Sottimano Cott&agrave; Barbaresco  
Castelmagno (*"Speaking of Sottimano, I believe I've made a discovery... ask for a bit of castelmagno cheese, it'll accompany it well."*)  
Murrazzono toma (*Daniel slowly drank his glass of Barbaresco, picking at pieces of seasoned Murrazzano toma.*)

Barolo (*He was working with a Barolo... he looked at the crowd... he had them"*

82 Ratti Barolo (*"Well structured, velvety, vital."*)

Salami and toma cheese (*"Would it be possible to have both?"*)

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
Coffee at the Savona (*"Memories often need a place where they can be stored. One's head alone isn't enough," Daniel said, pouring half a bag of sugar in his coffee.*)

Coffee at Ginotta (*"Find two more syringes"*)

Bagna Cauda, etc. (*He asked for bagna cauda, and a plate of vitello tonnato with roasted potatoes. He ordered the house red and, to Flop, who was wedged under the chair, he gave a piece of a breadstick, coarse and uneven.*)  
House red (*a light Dolcetto*)  
Cup of fruit and large coffee  

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

Salad and castelmagno cheese  
Glass of Roero Nebbiolo (with Amalia who *had poured a finger of the Roero, as if to take courage.*)

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
Favorita, plate of olives, salami (*"Looking for a glass of Favorita?" "If there's nothing local..."*)

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
Salad (*[He] had eaten a hearty salad at the hotel.*)

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
Serafino (*They... toasted with a Serafino, lightly *frizzante*.*)  
Vitello Tonnato, etc. (*They ate vitello tonnato and cold peppers with a small bagna cauda, then she wanted to try the tagliolini with meat ragu and rabbit with peppers.*)  
Chionetti Dolcetto, from Dogliani (*"Dogliani is important. We've been there, they have a beautiful cemetery."*)  
Goat cheese, fresh toma (*A cheese course arrived, small slivers of goat cheese, triangles of fresh toma.*)  
Barolo Chinato and an ice (*The server arrived with a cart of digestifs. He suggested a Barolo Chinato and an ice.*)  

Whiskey (*Silvio came in with a bottle of whiskey, two glasses, and a cup of ice.*)

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
Fresh orange and lemon juice (*He waited for him, drinking a fresh orange and lemon juice.*)

A "small plate" and a glass of Roero (*He asked Daniel if he'd also like a small plate and a glass of Roero... He returned with some slices of local salami, sausage from Bra, ham from Langhe, a bowl of sliced olives, pieces of aged Castelmagno cheese, and goat cheese from Val Varaita.*)

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
Pastis (*[He] orders an aperitif, a Pastis. He knows it's early and that surely his head will be pounding.*)

Sandwiches, etc. (*It went better at Sillano, where the small sandwiches of butter and anchovies, peppers and artichokes, salami and butter, and insalata russa, had just been made and placed, fresh and fragrant, on the shelves of the counter.*  
Tomato juice (but *Eta Beta ordered a sparkling Berlucchi and dived into the miraculous catch.*)

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
Grignolino (*But now he felt refreshed, maybe because of the Grignolino they were drinking, fresh raspberry, currant, and pepper, giving him a desire for revenge.*)  
Roast beef

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>
Vitello tonnato, etc. (*Daniel went around the long table, complimenting the dishes there, the vitello tonnato, the pesce finto, the tomato and onion salad, carne cruda all'Albese, prosciutto and chicken in gelatin.*)  
Breadsticks

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>
2003 Dolcetto di Chionetti (*"It's made by Quinto and Andrea in Dogliani." "14 percent alcohol for a Dolcetto is a lot, too much"*)

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>
Tea (*He didn't know why he'd asked for tea, possibly because he didn't want to drink water, and it was too early to ask for a glass of white.*)  
Nonino (*...two fingers... he tossed it down to feel the fire in his throat, he wanted to extinguish the question that he was about to ask.*)  

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>
