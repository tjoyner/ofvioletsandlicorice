The evening had gone well. It had been enjoyable. Daniel had done what he called the *three card trick*, an ironic presentation of himself and his profession. Seated at the tables were a dozen people, including a Japanese woman with a body like a mannequin, a very elegant English couple, and a table of Germans who were distracted and a little tipsy. It was aimed at them to get their attention and quiet them down.

With Giulio watching, he had filled twenty glasses with Favorita and twenty with Freisa, then asked the guests to blindfold themselves with their napkins. He'd have them taste a wine, and then ask if they had drunk a white or a red.

The table of Germans was wrong three out of four times, and the other guests didn't do much better. After one taste, the young Japanese woman and the English couple had no doubts. In the end, 13 out of 20 hadn't been able to distinguish a red from a white with their eyes closed, which is how it usually went at a tasting.

The second card that Daniel had thrown on the table was that of the spider web. He had a good young Dolcetto from Ratti in a dirty bottle with cobwebs, and a more modest Dolcetto from Battaglino in a clean bottle, both unlabeled. He asked them to taste and make a judgment about which of the two Dolcettos was better. Almost unanimously, with the exception of the English couple, they chose the Dolcetto in the clean bottle. Daniel was a little disappointed that the beautiful Japanese girl had also stumbled.

For the third and final card, Daniel had put the same wine in two unlabeled bottles, a white, the Ceretto Blang&egrave;, asking which of the two wines was better. They split almost in half. The English couple turned out to be the winners because they claimed they "didn't know how to choose," thus getting the right answer by default.

While going down Via Maestra, passing the lighted shop *Donne Vincenti*, containing delicate silver and black dresses that were draped on the female mannequins, top bargains, and pants with loud stripes, Daniel smiled, inhaling large puffs from the first Gauloise of the day. He recalled the faces of disbelief after he'd said the wines were the same. It was then that he'd seen Amalia appear in the room, hands firmly on her hips and with a smile split between satisfaction and defiance, as if she wanted to tell him that she wouldn't have been deceived. Deceived about what? Daniel asked himself, turning into the *Savona* piazza. About the wine? About what?

The bar was open, he sat under the arcades, there was bustle and merriment, music of an Italian summer translated, like almost everywhere, into American tones.

He asked the waiter for a gin and tonic, light. He'd only had a sip of Burgundy, but he wanted to be alert because he had missed a phone call at the close of his second night away from Paris.

He saw the Japanese girl pass by. He waved to her, half-rising from his chair. She saw him, slowed down, smiled at him. Daniel felt obliged to invite her to the table. With some surprise, Daniel saw that she accepted the invitation, coming over and sitting opposite him.

"My name is Maria Suzuki," she said, awkwardly holding out her hand and bowing her head. "My mother was from Rome."

Daniel took the tips of her fingers in his hand and smiled at her.

"Would you like something to drink?"

"You're French?"

"Yes, would you prefer to speak English?"

"I'm trying to learn about Italian wine. And also the language, which is neither mine nor yours. If we speak Italian maybe we'll understand each other better and also get some practice. Isn't that right?"

Daniel smiled, nodded yes. It didn't seem necessary to explain to her that he'd had an Italian grandfather who was a stationmaster in Villefranche.

"You didn't deceive me with the spider web, you know? I knew before I drank that it was a good wine. I had a grandfather in Osaka who made sake, and he told me that the spider webs protect the quality, the aging..."

Daniel didn't want to talk about wine, and even less about his little tricks. He said, "We live in a society of sexual phobia. A society of cleanliness. It's also clearly important in the cellar, but now a web, unless it's from Spider-Man, makes us shudder today."

Maria laughed, exposing the enamel of her small teeth.

"Can I get a drink?" she asked. 

"Whatever you want..." answered Daniel, beckoning the waiter to come over.

Maria looked him in the eye and asked, "Are you drinking mineral water?"

Daniel shook his head and responded, "No, it's a gin and tonic, light..."

"Same for me," said Maria to the waiter, then turned toward Daniel and asked, "The hard liquors don't ruin your palate?"

Daniel laughed. "80 percent of the time I taste with my nose. With this potato, see? And then I taste for my profession, and drink for pleasure, to remember, to forget, for nostalgia. Who knows... there are many reasons for drinking, right?"

"And also to be happy, or no?"

Daniel looked at her. She was beautiful. Japanese with long legs, a slender torso, her charcoal hair cut in bangs. She might be the same age as Nicole, and this thought disturbed him, but only, or so he wanted to believe, because the thought of Nicole reminded him that he still had a phone call to make before he could consider the day successfully over.

"I like Italian cities, they are quiet, slow, like our provinces. They don't have fast trains or subways. And the stores are better than, or as good as, Tokyo, but with discounted prices. Have you seen how many Armani, Missoni, and Dolce & Gabbana, there are in *Donne Vincenti*, across from the *Tastevin*?"

Daniel hadn't looked at the labels, to him they appeared to be the usual clothes that were taken from the display window and [tried on, the result never as good as on a lifeless mannequin](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#wornbut). Like a wine that's put in a [conservative bottle](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#likeawine), but also [a little gaudy](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#alittlegaudy), with its label and cork, its images and graphics, to catch a distracted eye, advertising, television. [While to him, the wine and its essence continued to tell its story through its fermentation, its desire to oxygenate, its desire to lightly settle inside the transparent glass.](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#whiletohim) 

Daniel looked at Maria. He'd never had a story, much less a story with an Asian. He looked at her eyes, her mouth, her bust like a teenager. He asked, switching to the familiar, "Why are you here? How did you come to Alba?"

"Tuscany, Veneto, and Piedmont, the lands of wine. My grandfather in Osaka said that the British wanted the wine of Piedmont, after their conflict with the French, but back then it wasn't possible. There weren't any roads or ports where it could be loaded. So the British went to Tuscany and Sicily to load their barrels. But my grandfather and my father said that it was Piedmont wine that should be taken home."

"What does you father do?" Daniel asked with a bit of weariness, looking in his pocket for a second Gauloise.

"He's the wine director at the Imperial Hotel. For him, it's important to find new wines for the management and customers. There's a lot of competition..."

"And your father sends you, Maria?" Daniel asked, biting the Gauloise that he had just lit.
