"Here, where wine is like oil and everyone has to do it better than everyone else."

The first 50 pages of the book are fascinating. Those who love wine deeply, those who are starting
to encounter it on their journeys, and those who have been to Langhe or who would like to
go there will be glued to the page. References to towns, historical vinewards and producers are 
perfectly integrated into the narrative, which seems to flow without particular upheavals 
and which slowly and delicately sketches the story and background, and above all, is very thought-provoking.

A French sommelier, Daniel, travels to Alba for a few days for work, and in-between his wine tasting 
classes at a local wine bar he visits the sites, crosses landscapes, and above all encounters *human portraits* 
that fully illustrate the great land that is the Langhe, and
which convey to the reader that personality, almost surly, introverted and timid, but blunt, of the people of this land.
This springs from his encounters with the men and women who will occupy well defined roles in the narrative, and 
who will become more significant, almost upsetting, in the life of our protagonist.

A sommelier with an "atypical" perspective, one might say, toward what, unfortunately, we are used to seeing at times today.
Observing, subdued and without boasting absolute certainties, during a quick and frugal meal, several dining companions 
swirling their glasses with circular motions to catch, necessarily and with every sip, who knows what undertones. This conveys what you 
realize is pure ostentation and above all, how those like him have been principally, though not entirely, responsible 
for this decadence.

The protagonist is French, as we said, but has in-depth knowledge of Piedmont wines in general, above all those of the Langhe, and
a love for that land that's almost touching, naive at times, and who is constantly "brought back to earth," demystified and almost
mocked by the first of the significant companions of his travels and stay who burst into the naration: Luciano, a taxi driver
who drinks only beer, who will shuttle him through hills and narrow streets and who has the role of
debunking, almost destroying at times, that majestic aura that each one of us experiences when we think of this wonderful land
and its wines. He's a kind of critical conscience who isn't afraid of bashing wine producers, politicians, critics, and anybody
who has the trait of definitively lifting and carrying the great wines of the Langhe to Mount Olympus, but at the same time of 
distorting their originality and simplicity, and of also having created over time greedy speculators more than hot-tempered and
simple winemakers. He doesn't talk about modernists versus traditionalists, as often happens, and still happens when reading
descriptions of the people and land of Barola and Barbaresco, but of forests disappearing to the detriment of vineyards, even
where there are no vineyards, or where they shouldn't be any, of crus that today have astromical economic value, when in
fact, until a few years ago, they were sold off to scrape together a nest egg to transfer to Turin and work at Fiat.

"A monotonous landscape: hills and hills of vines, all the same. Not even a fruit tree... all the orchards were cut down to make way for the vineyards... do you see a vegetable garden? Also gone. Then there is the Co-op and the Fortress of Petrini, out there somewhere... is that a beautiful fantasy, or what?"

Fantasy and ingenuity, talents that are also important for Daniel in his work, he who practically invented himself, at a certain
point in his life deciding, for his profession, to choose the wines for restaurant cellars that wanted to expand their selectionj
but those talents, in Luciano's mouth, become harsh, and are hard to digest for those who probably don't know much about those positions:

"Regarding inventive, we are inventive. Here in Langhe, everything's invention... we invented a paradise of vineyards for lovers of wine... hills that are the envy of Tuscany. All bull. Here you don't know what to do except eat and get drunk, if you can afford it."

Then there's an abrupt shift in the middle of the story and an ending, very cinematic and almost Americanized, that leaves a
slight, but decisive, bitter aftertaste. The events &ndash; personal, family, and amorous &ndash; of the protagonist at a certain point
completely monopolize the story, at times not easy to decipher and integrate. Above all there is a finale out of a Western film, 
about a final duel to the last sip and identification, that is cut off from the rest of the plot, and almost forced, as if wanting to get back to the "story," to the wine, but in a superficial way and not as masterfully integrated as in the initial part of the story.

Within the diverse world of food and wine reporting, written and virtual, few have talked about this book, perhaps precisely
because the book, and probably not the film, clash in comparison to Sideways, the American film that was much discussed, perhaps
too much, a few months ago, irritating famous local wine producers who complained about the fact that in Italy no one had thought
of decidating a cinematic work to one of the most representative products of our country.

It's a book I would recommend, because it's well-written, without linguistic excesses, with restrained and beautiful Italian. It
has interesting insights into the political world of Langhe wine that could easily be applied to other areas where substantially
the same things as those in Langhe have happened, and which continue to happen. It leaves in the reader a feeling half-way between
nostalgia and bitterness and makes the reader think, without excessive polemics.

The final section is worthy of a Hollywood film, in which the protagonist, one against all, but a with a few faithful companions to
cheer him on, accomplishes the impossible in a challenge to the last sip in the attempt of recognizing smells, flavors, and
finally wines with name, producer and vintage, that makes you smile and even a bit nervous, on the one hand, and on the other
seals the impressions that, little by little, emerge from the book and that maybe would make, finally, someone happy: if from this
novel would come a script for a local film on the world of wine, as some so recently implored after the release of the American
film mentioned above, it wouldn't be a big surprise. 

We close with one of the many jabs that come out of the sharp, witty, polemics of Luciano, probably the true alter-ego of the
author himself:

"... I can't take all this wine rhetoric anymore. We have only that and we build castles of lies. And there's no place for anything, for a memory. We all seem born gentlemen since this is no longer a land of ruin."
