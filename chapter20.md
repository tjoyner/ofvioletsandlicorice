"How do you feel?" asked Luciano. But the question didn't need an answer, so he continued, looking at him in the rear view mirror with the gaze of someone who could understand how Daniel was feeling: "Worse than if it were your stuff, right?" and then: "This is still the old Langhe, where they celebrate honor or a joke gone too far with the madness of the walls and of the earth. The rest is gone. Nothing else, just money disguised as vineyards and democracy disguised as communism."

Luciano fell silent, then said "Does it disturb you if I talk?"

Daniel shook his head, he felt the sweat on his hands and the dryness of his throat. He rubbed his hands on his pants and swallowed. He hadn't followed what Luciano was saying, to him the words seemed to arrive like leaves whipped by the wind, fragments of the memory of something that had already been repeated countless times. He just had to go and taste a bit of wine and nothing else. That was the challenge, with his palate and his nose and his experience. Nothing else. And if there was more, it wasn't the time to remember it. 

"On my terms, Frenchman..." Baravalle had said. And he had accepted, without looking at Amalia. He had looked at her just before, before going to accept the challenge: bottles instead of cards, he instead of Amalia. On his terms: wines, vintages, terrain. He would choose.

Then he hadn't looked at Amalia anymore. He didn't want her eyes or her smell to disturb him. He had telephoned Luciano to come and get him and take him into the hills, with no destination in mind, just to rinse out his eyes and open up his nose.

"Who checks that the wine is the right one?" Luciano asked. "Trusting Baravalle is like trusting the government or the Lotto."

Daniel laughed. "Some precautions will be taken, I hope. We think it will be the same producers. There will be something written down... in addition to delivery labels... there's a farm and a lot of land [at stake](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#dimezzo)," said Daniel, painfully distracted by the thought that this was not a typical tasting, a typical demonstration in front of an audience more or less competent.

"A big responsibility, you've taken... you may not allow me to ask you why, but whatever your reason is you have all my respect, for what it's worth."

Daniel shrugged. He could have responded to him: for a look. Or as he told Nicole: for a kiss. But that wouldn't be enough, that response, neither for Luciano nor for himself. He said: "For the challenge."

And maybe it was true. Inside that response was also the look and the kiss of Amalia, but it was inside: the look and the kiss of Amalia weren't part of the challenge. Was that so? Daniel didn't want to ask himself that. It would be like trying to solve the mystery of existence, or even, simply, that of the human universe.

He laughed and said "[We could say that it attracts more pussy than who knows what](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#unpelodifiga). But it's true and it isn't true. Right?"

Luciano was taken aback. He slowed on a curve, then returned his gaze to the rear-view mirror, looking for Daniel's eyes.

"I wouldn't say that. Certainly Amalia can put thoughts in your head. That too, of course. But I would go further, believe me. If you thrashed Baravalle, for me it would be like regaining a bit of memory of this land, of how it was. A bit of justice in the world, [to put it grandly](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#dirlaallagrande)."

"Now that's a big responsibility. Too much for what I'm going to do, taste a bit of wine, which I hope to recognize..."

Luciano didn't say anything else, he continued to drive smoothly through the hills, continuously rising and falling, passing through towns both empty and flourishing. Daniel didn't even look at the names. He had rolled down the window, squinting his eyes and resting his nose on the edge of the window. He had to feel the *terroir*, that was the secret. It was all there, or everywhere: in every bottle he had drunk and in every town in the world; the secret to understanding was just this: grasp the *terroir*, easy to say, but a Zen practice to put in place, or an equally complex communion with existence.

Daniel was in a good mood. He liked to travel with his nose, stick it into the earth, launch his sense of smell beyond the view. Homer, more than Lucretius, was his poet, how many smells and scents there were in his poems. In his old age, he'd thought many times, he like to write a book about the smells and scents in the classics. In those, at least, he'd had time to read. 

"Would you like to eat or drink something?"

Daniel heard Luciano's voice and opened his eyes. There were in Roddino. They had climbed high, he had begun to lose the smells that he knew and tried to hold on to them, to drag them along: [getting away and going up had been good for him](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#allontanarsi). It was a good exercise that Luciano, unknowingly, had offered him. He said yes, he would gladly eat something.

"[Two *tagliatelle*, with some Gemma](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#duetagliatelle)," said Luciano, "listen... we've climbed into the dark Langhe, [where even real fathers no longer grow](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#noncrescono)."
