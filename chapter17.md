"Phoning your mother? What will you tell her?"

Daniel felt ashamed that he'd asked that question. But it was the morning after Amalia had reacted with the fury of that bonfire.

They'd gone back to the hotel in silence, without comment. Maria had taken Giulio home, and they returned with Flop, who hugged the walls of the *Savona* and the stairs, then stopped in front of Nicole's room.

They'd said good night with a kiss on the forehead, Daniel had called Flop, and Nicole had asked to leave him with her. He'd gone to his room and taken a shower to remove the dampness of the night and the smell of ash. Then, unable to sleep, he'd taken cards from his suitcase and began to play his usual solitaire on the table close to the TV, wondering what feelings were hidden in the words that he just couldn't say. 

He'd gone on for hours, maybe two, maybe three, until he felt tired, confused by the colors and the suits, the runs, and the faces of the queens and the jacks, and had decided to go to bed.

Now, in broad daylight, he'd knocked on Nicole's door. She was awake, and had asked Silvio to call her mother in Paris.

"I'll say that I'm fine. Why? To see if she'll let me go to Tokyo. Maria asked me if I'd like to go to Tokyo. I've never seen Japan. You'll let me go to Tokyo, right?"

Daniel sat down in the cretonne armchair, near the window.

He hadn't expected that request.

"To Tokyo, with Maria?" he asked, to buy time. He looked at her, she had a calm demeanor, was smiling. Buying more time, he said, "Start by hearing what your mother has to say... we need her to agree. As you know."

He'd taken the easy road and felt ashamed. He'd let her do whatever she wanted and the results had certainly arrived. But it was hard to choose 'no,' once you got off on the wrong foot. He said, "We don't know much about Maria... Japan is far away..."

She laughed and threw her arms around his neck. "Japan is far away and we don't know much about Maria, Dad... but what do you know about where I go, every day, and with whom?"

Daniel wanted to tell her that he knew that, he knew that very well. He'd seen the result. But he said nothing. He let himself be taken into the embrace and closed his eyes. He couldn't remember when his daughter had embraced him so fondly and happily. He felt stunned, while Flop joined their embrace, fumbling with his paws on her calves and yelping.

Daniel left her embrace. He didn't want to be there when the call from his ex-wife came. He said, "I'll wait for you downstairs. I'll ask for breakfast."

He left, followed by Flop, who evidently had forgiven the treachery of the night before.

At the reception desk, in addition to Silvio he saw Luciano, who was drinking his first beer of the day, straight from the bottle.

"Would you like breakfast?"

Daniel nodded, heading toward the dining room.

Luciano asked, "Can I keep you company?"

Daniel would have liked to say no, that his daughter was coming downstairs. But then, thinking he'd have to listen to Laurencine's comments about her possible trip to Tokyo, and fearful of having to console Nicole for the expected refusal of her mother, resulting in a promise that he would intervene to persuade her, he looked at Luciano and nodded.

Daniel went to sit down at his usual table, near the window overlooking the courtyard, and Luciano came over with his beer, sitting down in front of him.

"I thought it would be better if you knew..." Luciano began, looking around.

"Knew what?"

"Baravalle is trying for the big score. He means to denounce Amalia, pass her off as crazy, and take the other half of Ginotta."

Daniel smiled. "Just a minute. It's not that simple. Amalia isn't crazy, she's just exasperated."

"He and his friends say she tried to burn them at the table while they were eating."

"We were there too," said Daniel.

"The flames were seen from Madonna di Coma and from Guarene. The wind carried the ashes up to the church square."

"She only burned some old furniture."

"With that head of his, for now he's trying. He's already made the complaint."

Daniel got up from the table, nervously. Then he sat down. He didn't know what to say except that everything seemed to be plunging into absurdity.

Nicole arrived to break the silence, pouting, saying, "As usual, at the beginning it was 'no.' By the end of the call, she said that she would discuss it with you and then decide. I was wrong to tell her that Maria took care of the wines for her father. She immediately thought it was a conspiracy between you two to get me away from her."

This time, Daniel laughed. He said, "It would have been better to tell her that Maria was a dancer in a club, for Christ's sake, or a bouncer at a gay disco. Why did you have to tell her she dealt with wine?"
<!-- Page 130 -->

Nicole relaxed. She'd been afraid that her father would rush to call her mother back for yet another quarrel. Luciano had stood up, not wanting to enter into their discussion. He wanted to leave them, but without appearing rude. He wanted to say goodbye, to ask Daniel if he needed him.

"Who's the gentleman?" Nicole asked.

"Luciano is a private driver, besides being a beer drinker and a critical observer of this beautiful land of Italian wine," said Daniel, thinking about the phone call with Laurencine.

"Good," said Nicole, "then you can take me to Maria."

Daniel looked at her and asked himself, all of a sudden, if the presence of Maria wasn't a fortune that turned up too unexpectedly, and as such, was suspect. 

He decided not to think about it. He wanted to be alone, at least for a while.

"Very well. Take Flop too."

Then, turning towards Luciano, he asked, "Can you take her to the *Hotel Cavalieri*?"
