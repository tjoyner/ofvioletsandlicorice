"The bets are honored," Baravalle had said, returning the piece of paper on which Giulio had given up his half of Ginotta. Amalia had taken it, folded it many times and placed it in the neckline of her dress.

"You really tucked in that wad of paper," Nicole said.

"Why didn't you rip it up immediately?" Maria asked.

Daniel was sitting on a deckchair in the middle of the yard, Flop circled around him, suspicious, offended at having been left there on a chain and, now free, was hopping around looking to be petted, but not by Daniel who had called him several times.

"She'll put it in a frame so that Giulio won't forget," said Daniel getting up from the deckchair. He felt a tingling in his legs, he needed to take a walk. He walked to the vineyard and saw that some rows had been cleared of weeds, many plants had been pulled up, [and the plowed soil was as black as a water snake](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#nerecome).

"Baravalle had already started to clear it..."

Giulio's voice came by surprise from behind his back. Daniel turned.

"You should continue: you have earth from Barbaresco," Daniel said.

"This time, I think it's possible. I saw Amalia enter the vineyard like she does at the *Tastevin*, as the owner. It's just as well, [maybe all this crap has a silver lining](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cazzate)..."

Giulio looked at Daniel and hastily added: "If they come across someone like you, Daniel."

Daniel shrugged, looked for boulder where he could sit, and lit a cigarette: it was the first of the day and he inhaled it slowly, drawing the smoke toward the center of his stomach to cover up the many scraps of scents and odors that he'd inhaled.

"Time helps. The traumas are absorbed with time and the memory softens them. Now Ginotta really belongs to you, and her feeling of guilt for having unintentionally caused your father's death may become the impetus that will restore life to this hill."

"It wasn't Amalia's fault. That night my father had gone out to cover the vines, not to look for her. I had said to him that Amalia was safe in the stable. She's not to blame," Giulio said forcefully, standing up and pointing towards the stable: She was there, all warm with her dolls, I had accompanied her there. Dad knew it, I had told him as I went back to the kitchen with my mother and he ran with the tarps toward the vines."

Daniel saw a shadow stretching across the ground and cutting across his legs. He turned: it was Amalia. He looked at her quizzically. He looked at Giulio. He saw the eyes of two siblings meet. Then those of Giulio slowly lowered. 

"You never told me. You never told me ..." said Amalia strongly. Giulio turned away, muttered something as he walked toward the yard. Amalia dropped to the ground: "He never told he, Daniel. Do you understand? He let me believe that Dad had come looking for me... that it was my fault. Why?"

Amalia was shaking with hysterical tears, she struck her legs with her fists, stomped her feet on the ground.

"Now he's said it to you. Now, you know."

"Why after all this time?"

Daniel put out his cigarette on the ground. He wondered if it would be worth the suppositions, the justifications, that wouldn't be difficult to offer her. He wondered if it was worth the pain. The yard was already so full of words.

He said: "Today he's given back to you what he had to. It's not late, take it as an olive branch."

Amalia stiffened, then her body slowly began to relax, and a soft smile opened up on her face. She asked: "And what gift can I possibly give you, Daniel?"

Daniel blushed, shrugged his shoulders, and said: "For now, there is my fee for the courses..."

Amalia laughed and rose to her feet, holding out her hand: "And then?" she asked mischievously.

Daniel allowed himself to be dragged out of the vineyard, encountering the gaiety of the voices coming from the courtyard of Ginotta.

About 20 people were moving around a long white table, taking plates, glasses, fruit baskets and bottles; Daniel recognized some of the people who had attended his tasting course, and then Silvio and Luciano. He would have preferred to be outside of the confusion into which Amalia was pushing him, but he knew it wasn't possible: this was a celebration of the vineyard, he told himself, and he said it to Amalia. She nodded. "Yes, a celebration of the vineyard," she said.

Daniel was compelled, however, to sit at the head of the table, with Amalia on his right and on his left, Maria and Nicole. On the opposite side he faced Giulio, and next to him the English couple who hadn't missed a tasting, and [whom Daniel had seemed to have crossed paths with on the way to Barbaresco](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#incrociato).

"The old train station in Barbaresco is beautiful. Now it's in ruins, the *B* in the ceramic by Mondov&iacute; must have fallen. We took the train there to Asti as children," Amalia was telling him. "Above Asili someone has planted about 50 olive trees."

"The one near the church doesn't give olives," Daniel responded, "an old farmer said that to Luciano and me, when we were going to look at the vineyards of Asili."

"Ceretto also makes Barbaresco there, but you recognized the one that was made by Bruno Giacosa... you have a good palate."
<!-- Page 153 -->

Daniel took the tip of his index finger: "And this, no joke."

Amalia smiled and turned to the girls. She asked, "Is everything to your taste?"

On the tray table there was [insalata russa](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#insalatarussa) and [vitello tonatto](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#vitellotonnato), there was salami from Rodini and sausage from Bra, there was a plate of [carne cruda of Albese](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#carnecruda) and chopped meat with egg yolk and Dijon mustard, there was a cold roast and peppers with anchovies and garlic, and [2 liter bottles](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#pintoni) of red wine. 

"Does Luciano have his beer?" Daniel asked, and from the end of the table Luciano raised an opaque yellow mug.

"A chest, in ice, under the chair," he responded, smiling. It was the first time, thought Daniel, that he'd seen Luciano smile. Perhaps by the end of the night he might succeed in making him drink a glass of Moscato.

"See how well your daughter and Maria get along," Amalia said, and Daniel looked at the two girls: they were shoulder to shoulder, they smiled at each other, whispering and exchanging breadcrumbs and prosciutto wrapped on [breadsticks](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#rubata). Nicole was bursting with happiness. He would have liked, he thought for a moment, for Laurencine to see her like this.

"Feelings are a wonderful thing," said Amalia.

"Except for stubbornness," Daniel answered, asking himself, immediately after, what he had meant to say.

He felt a tail thumping his leg. It was Flop, perhaps he was giving the answer that he hadn't found. He patted him on the back and gave him a breadstick. 

He started a toast after the other one, directed at Daniel, to Ginotta, to Amalia, to the vineyard. Everyone stood up with a glass in hand. Daniel looked at Giulio, he had a veil of melancholy. Raising his glass, he said: "A toast to Giulio, we owe it to him that we are here, in happy company." Hearty laughter rose and arms stretched their glasses toward Giulio, who, caught off guard, remained seated. After a moment of embarrassment, he stood up, sticking out his glass, and, finally relaxed, smiled.

"What did you mean to say?" Amalia asked him.

"To say, what?" answered Daniel.

"When you said 'Except for stubbornness' you were referring to feelings, right?"

Daniel looked at the long table, someone got up to look for shade under the hazelnut trees or the large Scottish pine behind the farmhouse, on the side of the Tanaro, someone fell asleep at the table; he looked at Nicole and Maria who continued to be deep in conversation and were nibbling cornmeal biscuits; he gazed at the soft blue sky and looked for the sun. He found it jumping from one hill to another like a child's ball on a sandy beach. It was the color orange, but would become dark shortly, and would go to die, he now knew, behind Monviso, like the last notes of a tango. 

He looked at Amalia and felt a chill down his spine that sat him up in his chair. He saw that her eyes were a bright violet. Only then did he notice that she wore a fuchsia blouse and a black skirt, the color of licorice. On her neck was a thin silver chain. He repeated to himself that she was beautiful but stubborn.

Trying to answer her, he said, "You've kissed me only once. Why Amalia, why?"

She looked down, touched the chain with her thumb and index finger.

"I'll tell you why," Daniel continued, "for stubbornness, not feelings. And if there were feelings, they were less than your need to be stubborn. With yourself, with others."

She stopped playing with the chain, reached out her hand, looking for his.

"It's not true..." she said.
<!-- Page 155 -->

Daniel shook his head: "Stubbornness won't be enough to restore the vineyard, remember that."

He let her take his hand, and looked in her eyes. Then, as if someone had turned on music, he got up and pushed her to the center of the yard.

"Would you like to dance?" he asked, and without waiting for a response, he put an arm around her waist and began to whistle *Under the Bridges of Paris*, while to his nose there returned, insistently, a scent of violets.
