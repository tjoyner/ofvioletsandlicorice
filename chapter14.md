"You have a dog? Since when..."

The evening hadn't ended as Daniel wanted. After Baravalle's entrance in the *Savona* and the fight with Giulio, he'd had to offer Nicole many explanations to give her the impression that she would have peace and quiet, a holiday in a serene place. 

His daughter didn't seem shocked, she had reacted with a shrug, snorting, saying they were boring "things," that the peasants needed the city, and also that he would do better to get back to the wine cellars, if he really wanted to, but in Paris. She was then distracted by asking Maria where she went, at night, in Tokyo.

Daniel had been caught up in the thought of the meeting between Amalia and Giulio. He had called to tell her that he was with them. Amalia didn't ask how it had happened, her first reaction was violent: "Wait until I have him in my hands," she said. "Wait until I have him in front of me. Where is he now?" 

Daniel had told her they'd just arrived at the *Savona*, that Nicole was also there, and she had calmed down. "How's your daughter?" she'd asked. And he had rambled on about the intense perfume of the oleanders in Nice, on the colors of the rocks and the leaves of the trees of the Val Roya, on the unique arcades of Cuneo. 

But Amalia had cut him short, saying "Send him home afterwards. I'll be waiting for him."

And now he and Nicole were in his room defending themselves from the celebrations of Flop. It was Silvio who reminded him, holding out a bowl of soup as they entered the room, that Flop was above waiting for them. Daniel had completely forgotten. 
<!-- Page 113 -->

He opened the door of Nicole's room, then headed toward his. 

"How's your room?" he asked when she got there, while Flop finished licking his bowl. 

"You have a dog? Since when...?" Nicole asked, petting Flop. 

"A young truffle dog, but not good enough, it seems, so they made him a foundling, and he's found me."

Nicole sat down on the bed and Flop licked her hands.

"Are you taking him to Paris?"

Even that might become a problem, thought Daniel, but I'd rather think about it when the time comes. 

"I couldn't keep it, you know Nicole..."

"Poor thing, he needs company," Nicole said, then, after a brief silence, added "What will happen between Giulio and Amalia?" and then, after a short pause, "What's she like, Amalia?" 

Daniel looked at Nicole. He could have responded that he didn't know her enough to be able to say how she was, that to him she seemed as contradictory as all women who have won their freedom, who pay for it with solitude and with responsibility for which they aren't always equipped. Women strong and fragile, confused. 

But he said nothing of what he was thinking. He said, "You'll meet her tomorrow. Now go to sleep, it's late. You haven't told me if you like your room."

Nicole got up from the bed and headed to the hallway. Flop followed her. 

"If you want to keep him with you..." said Daniel, following her. 
<!-- Page 115 -->

Nicole opened the door of her room and Flop slipped between the door and the frame and began to sniff, first the bed, then the closet and the dresser, and then the bathroom door.

"Maybe he's thirsty... should I leave it to you?"

Nicole nodded to him, yawning next to her suitcase, then after a moment of indecision turned to Daniel, threw her arms around him, and kissed him on the cheek. "Ciao, Dad," she said "I'm glad to be here with you."

Daniel, caught by surprise, mumbled something and retreated into the hallway, then turning around and leaning in the doorway said, "If you need anything, knock on the wall: I'm on the other side. Good Night."
<br/> <br/> <br/> 

He slept a dreamless sleep, a sleep long and calm. When he awoke, Daniel had two surprises: Nicole and Flop were not in their room, and Luciano was waiting at the bar to bring him to Ginotta at Amalia'a invitation.

He asked Silvio what time it was, and for a double espresso. Sitting at the counter, he listened to Silvio tell him that an hour earlier, at 9, the Japanese girl had come to take his daughter and Flop, and that Nicole &ndash; "That's her name, right?" &ndash; had asked him to tell her father that they were going for a ride through the hills of the Roero and that around noon they would phone to ask where they could go to eat together. 

Daniel, blowing on his hot coffee, asked himself if he was all right or not with Nicole's decision: not even waiting for the first day, not asking him if he had already made plans for the day, he felt a lack of sensitivity. But as he got to the bottom of his cup he also told himself that her independence so suddenly in a place that was new to her could be a good sign of adaptability. Besides, he sympathized with Maria. Yes, Maria &ndash; it seemed to him that the two girls had quickly developed a rapport, her presence was fortunate, an encounter that continued to lighten his stay in Alba. 

<!-- Page 115 -->
He asked "They also took Flop?"

Silvio told him yes, saying shortly after that Luciano was outside waiting for him. Daniel hadn't called him, wasn't expecting him.

"Amalia called him from Ginotta," said Silvio, turning towards the coffee machine. 

Daniel got up from the stool and without saying goodbye slipped through the hotel door. Luciano was outside, waiting with the engine running. "Did something happen?" asked Daniel, getting into the car.

"Nothing that I'm aware of," said the taxi driver, leaving. "Amalia called me, at 8. She told me to come and wait for you and your daughter to ask if you wanted to go up to Ginotta. Your daughter isn't here?" Luciano asked.

Daniel didn't answer, he was calming down. He had feared that Amalia had suddenly called for help.

While driving to Altavilla, Luciano turned to asked about Nicole. 

"Did your daughter already arrive at Nice?"

Now Daniel remembered the illness of his wife and asked, "Yes, my daughter arrived, everything's fine. But how's your wife?"

"Good, my wife is also good. You know women... they panic. She just had a drop in pressure, a bit of tachycardia, and she goes haywire. At home we have all the stabilizers for these cases. But if the doctor doesn't give them to her, they don't work."

Some purple iris was beginning to pierce, above the river bank, the bushes and grass at the edge of the cornfields. It was a day of warm wind that rose from the plain of Cuneo, after climbing over the small Alps of Bisalta. A wind that brought jitters, and rippled the first leaves of the poplars.
<!-- Page 116 -->

"Should I wait for you?" Luciano asked, stopping the car under the avenue of beech trees that led to Ginotta. Daniel shook his head and got out, choosing to cross the abandoned vineyard going up to the large farm. The ground was dry, rock hard, the branches of the vines hungry in a tangled web of silk.

Daniel, extricating himself with difficulty, reached the yard. Amalia was sitting in front of the rear door. She was wearing a faded, light blue smock. She clutched between her legs a colander for the skins of the potatoes she was peeling.

Daniel looked at her and thought he saw the gestures that his mother or his grandmother, or any country woman, would have made, in years past. Where was the Amalia of the *Tastevin*, Daniel asked himself, all efficiency, with the air of a woman who knows where she's going?

"[What did I do wrong](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cosahosbagliato)?" she asked when Daniel was in front of her. 

"[And what isn't wrong](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cosanonsisbaglia)?" answered Daniel, going to sit on the steps of the small concrete sidewalk that followed the perimeter of Ginotta. 

"However one does something, there's always a degree of error," continued Daniel, searching in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes: he had forgotten to smoke yesterday, he thought. He also did it to buy time. 

"Yes, but I'd at least like to see the correct part."

"Where's Giulio?" Daniel asked, lighting a cigarette that he had to straighten, out of a pack that seemed to have suffered from the tension and nervousness that Daniel had been subjected to in recent days.

"I left him downstairs... this was all I was able to say to him: '[Do you have any idea](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#tenerendiconto)?' Daniel, do you know what I said to him: 'Do you have any idea?' That's what I told him. I wanted to kill him, break the head of that asshole, and all I was able to tell him was that stupid 'Do you have any idea?'".
<!-- Page 117 -->

Daniel tapped his ashes and inhaled deeply, more to hold his breath than to smoke. He looked at Amalia, crying silently, her tears slowly falling on the potato peels. To distract himself, Daniel tried to hear if some of them fell on the aluminum with a different sound. His self-absorption was broken by the sharp sound of the colander being thrown on the sidewalk.

Amalia had risen abruptly and crossed the yard, screaming, "I'm a prisoner in my own home..."

[She walked on the white line of cement that traced on the ground the border of her sorrow](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#tracciata). She stepped on it again and again, repeating: "Prisoner in my house twice. What have I done to deserve this? What?"

Daniel went over to her slowly. He had the sun in his eyes and the blue of the sky absorbed her light blue dress, but the patch of her coppery hair remained to show him where the grief was. [He walked across the yard until he reached it, then enveloped her awkwardly in his arms, without saying anything, because he had nothing to say except that pain is born far away and descends downward, just like the trickles that become streams or rivers depending on the terrain they encounter, and also that they can't be controlled by us, not enough.](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#riviofiumi)

Amalia was rigid, she didn't seem to notice that embrace, she stood motionless in the middle of the yard, as if she wanted to take root, without taking the arms that were wrapped around her chest.

Daniel held her like that, for some time, waiting for her to raise her face up to his, and for another kiss to come. But it never did.
