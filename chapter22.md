The *Giardino* hotel was in a clearing of birch trees: a rectangle of cement and glass between straw huts. The central hall was cold, with a pink marble floor and florescent lights. Daniel blinked his eyes, the light bothered him. He headed toward the back of the room, where he'd seen Amalia and Giulio waiting for him and a nearby group of five or six people surrounding Baravalle.

"When do we start?" he said.

He felt nervous and wanted to concentrate. They had washed the floor, he smelled bleach. He asked to move the table to a corner away from the doors and windows. He turned his back on those who wanted to speak to him, and [waved to Amalia](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#fecesegno). He put his hands over his ears several times, as if he wanted to uncork them. Then he headed toward the two glasses that waited for him on a silver platter. He looked at them, they were the same garnet color. [He turned them around](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cigirointorno), *Same wine* he thought. *A Nebbiolo, perhaps*. He picked up a glass and brought it to the bridge of his nose. He began to speak, slowly: "Garnet colored, hints of orange and pink fingernail, tending towards white." He lowered his arm and sniffed the contents of the glass: "From its smell, it's a wild wine, with notes of game, I would say tanned hides, leather and fumes from an old fireplace, it has tar, tar that finishes with marks of pepper and clove.

Daniel stopped. He closed his eyes, put aside the smells and then, slowly, tilted the glass because the wine was showing him its legs, and touched the rim: "A full-bodied wine, warm, with hints of bitterness on a base of prominent tannins, a powerful wine. This is a Barolo from 1978, a Barolo from the Beppe Rinaldi winery.
<!-- Page 144 -->

Not waiting for confirmation, he had put down the glass and taken the one at its side. He gave it a look: "Garnet colored also, but with hints of orange, of church bricks." He approached the glass with his nose, turning it slowly and getting a tickling in his nostrils. He said: "It seems tenuous, but then it blossoms, opens in full aromas, inviting, with notes of licorice, mint, camphor." Daniel brought the glass back to his mouth, towards the upper lip. "A warm wine, harmonious, well-balanced between structure and tannins. I'd say," he stopped for a moment, feeling with his tongue an unexploded drop, "also a Barolo, again from 1978, from Aldo Conterno di Bussia Soprana in Monforte."

From the murmurs that he heard, Daniel knew that he had read them correctly, but he wasn't surprised: they were prominent wines that he had recommended for refined and demanding cellars.

He sat down without looking at anyone, waiting for them to prepare the table for the next tasting. He would have preferred that they start off with less full-bodied wines, but also &ndash; [he knew Baravalle well](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#losapevabaravalle) &ndash; that misdirection was part of the challenge. And anyway, he was trained in moving from a robust wine to an unstructured wine, from a red to a white to a ros&eacute;, he just had to identify, reset, and start over.

As he would have to do now, in front of that large glass which had been placed in the center of the table. He stood up and approached it looking at the colors: they eluded him, but not because of the refractions of the bad lighting in the room, no. It was the body of the wine itself that offered, like a precious stone, too many facets, shifts in tone, to be able to grasp the consistency of the colors. Daniel shrugged, he said that the color would come through the taste. He lifted the glass delicately and asked for brotherly help from his nose, because he sensed that like the colors, there would also be many flavors. He sniffed slowly, trying to distinguish them and send them towards distant memories and past experiences, because from the first smell he felt that he'd drunk it before, that wine.

He smelled again, then began his recitation: "Wine to be rested in the glass to open it up. Hints of cooked fruit and, I would say, cherry liqueur, moss, candied orange peel, leather, linden tea, coffee grounds, cocoa, lacquer, yes, lacquer, and then brined olives, candles, cinnamon, nutmeg, strawberry tree honey, acacia wood, spent match and even... but yes: oilcloth."
<!-- Page 145 -->

He brought the glass to his lower lip, towards the left, and let a small sip wet it. "[It's well-balanced](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#spigolosamente), [multi-faceted](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#sfaccettature)." Daniel took a little bit of wine towards the center of the mouth, it was there that it showed its structural complexity, its density. Acids and tannins in harmony, breathing in the glass. Daniel placed it on the table, turning it around again. He stopped thinking, held his breath, waited for the memory to come back to him. Then he said: "It's a Sor&iacute; Tild&iacute;n, 1989, from Gaja." He heard a buzz of approval, and a curse. It came from Baravalle, and he knew why: no more than 12 thousand of these bottles were put into circulation each year, and there were years, in '80, in '84, then '87, '91, '94, in 2002 and the next, in which bottling was suspended because the producer didn't consider the quality to be good enough.

Daniel felt the thrill of satisfaction and a confirmation: For those particular wines, niche wines, [it took only expertise to pick them up](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#prenderci), it was easier to mistake the vintage of a great wine. He sat back down. He wondered how many more wines he'd have to examine, and cast out the thought of the one on which he would fall, the one whose identity and personality he would be unable to recognize. He feared [blended wines, those of fantasy](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#assemblati), but counted on the pride of Baravalle, his traditionalism. In that he would be stubborn, as he had already demonstrated with the Sor&iacute; Tild&iacute;n, but in his own way, fair.
<!-- Page 146 -->

Someone signaled to him that the next tasting was ready. Daniel looked at the glass: another prominent wine. From its color, Daniel thought it also came from Nebbiolo, the color was again garnet red with sparkles of sunset, when the sun, the color of a squeezed orange, goes to die between one hill and the next, as if it were dancing the tango with a gay melancholy.

Daniel took the glass gently and let his nose breathe it in. He recognized the scents of childhood, that of voilets, delicate and clean, and the intensity of licorice. What came to mind was a small cemetery in the countryside of Villefranche that was covered by violets in late February, and Alphonsine's shop, where he went to get colored mints inside white paper cones, and the sticks and strings of licorice. There was violets and licorice but also another more intense odor or scent. What was it? Odor or scent, the two sensations of pleasure and disgust together. Daniel smiled and said, yes, that it could only be truffle, white truffle. 

"This is an excellent Barbaresco, from a great vintage, 1989," he said, knowing it wasn't enough. But where did it come from? Like seeing a movie, he remembered the tours in the car with Luciano, beyond Ginotta towards Treiso, Neive, Barbaresco, and the hills of Tanaro, where the Nebbiolo grapes made the best Barbaresco, those of a ruby color, where the wine smelled of violets and licorice but also of ripe plum, of light toasting and spice, and leather. But in this glass there was more, there was a flavor of truffles that would take him to a particular vineyard, and only that one. He remembered that from Barbaresco they had descended to the old train station, and near a votive chapel Luciano had said: "We are at Asili." Daniel had seen a large olive tree and then a semi-circle of vineyards at midday, [resting on the curve of the hilly terrain](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#orografica). A fortunate, unique, exposure. He had asked whose they were, and when Luciano had given the name of the producer, he had recalled unforgettable bottles. Like those from which the glass in front of him had been poured. 
<!-- Page 147 -->

Daniel smiled, deep inside of him. He felt he couldn't possibly be wrong. He repeated: "Barbaresco Asili, from 1989, produced by Bruno Giacosa."

This time he sought out Amalia's eyes and saw her smile. He looked for those of Nicole, found them, and winked at her. She waved, opening the palm of her hand. Daniel returned to looking at Amalia, her face had relaxed, she was sitting in the front row next to Giulio, who had his arms bent and his hands clasped between his knees. He didn't want to look for other faces. He went back to sit down, felt his dry throat, and asked for a glass of water. He needed to stop for a moment and breathe slowly: when he was tense the aroma of his body made itself felt and ended up distracting him. He sought calm. He told himself that he was almost finished but that he should expect one more [last ditch attempt](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#corpodicoda). He told himself that what someone was placing on the silver tray was the last glass of the morning.

He looked at it, like a bull does a matador, and began to study it: the color was dark, of well fired brick. He thought of a land without sandstone or rock. Where was Baravalle taking him? 

Daniel brought the glass to his nose. He immediately felt a scent of spring: also violets, but dark, and then cherries, the [*maroda*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#maroda), and then uncut roses and campfire smoke and also white chestnuts, which are eaten on All Soul's Day. But there were others, and Daniel said so in a clear voice, [as they gradually came to him between his tongue and palate](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#manoamano): there is sand and seashells, sand and seashells from warm seas, sub-tropical. Then reflecting inwardly, he said to himself: "It isn't from the land of Barolo, no blue marl soil, not Barbaresco with its white marl. Here there's sand, we are in the land of Roero. Here's where Baravalle has taken me, here are those colors of kilned bricks. Are we between Ceresole and Canale?"

<!-- Page 148 -->
Daniel periodically took a few sips, swelling his cheeks, looking for the taste of peach. There was, together with licorice, an amalgam of red fruit, ripe, mixed with the sand and the shells. It had an expansive taste, complex, aristocratic, that was wrapped in sweet and gentle tannins. It was a wine that had had the right amount of water, a little bit of snow, the warmth of spring, the bright heat of Summer, and a pleasant Autumn: a fortunate evolution.

That's when he was disturbed by an aroma of vanilla that wasn't vanilla. Most likely it was the boiled chestnuts. Daniel focused himself, when suddenly a smell leaped at him, and [a black rip plunged into his nostrils](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#strapponero), like on a movie screen when the film breaks.

Then his nose was filled with dankness, and his ears perceived the arrival of Flop, his footsteps on the floor. He was wet, as if he'd fallen into a vat of water, or had crossed the Tanaro river. His coat stank of the wild, warm stones, new willow trees and mulberry leaves.

He wagged his tail.

"Away, away, take him away..." said Daniel, irritated.

Someone, maybe Maria, maybe Amalia, pushed Flop outside the hall. Daniel asked his sense of smell to come back there, where he was. He tried to absorb the odors of the dog and put them aside, far away, where they wouldn't interfere with the delicate flavors of the fruit. He asked them to help. He repeatedly rubbed his nose between his thumb and index finger, as if he were facing a dive into the sea. And he dove.

[And he recovered](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#siriprese).

"A dramatic wine, Mediterranean, epic," Daniel said, "so I felt identifying this wine, which I have drunk only once, but I believe I can recognize a Roche d'Ampsej from 1996, by Matteo Correggia, one of the greatest winemakers &ndash; can I say it? &ndash; of the 20th century.
<!-- Page 149 -->

Daniel put down his glass as the applause reached him. He was tired, he saw a glass door to the garden, opened it and tried to breathe any scent that wasn't wine. He smelled an odor of fresh manure and went over to it.
