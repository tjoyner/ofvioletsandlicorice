Daniel looked at the time &ndash; it was five in the afternoon, outside the sun would still be hot and you'd see large patches of light on the front of the buildings and on the cobblestones of the piazza. He'd slept a couple of hours after returning from Bergolo, and had eaten a hearty salad at the hotel. He hadn't gotten any phone calls from the *Tastevin*; he'd hoped that Amalia had been looking for him. He felt confused, after that kiss Amalia had shown indifference, almost coldness, as if their feelings were the same as at the beginning of their professional relationship. He no longer knew what value to give to those lips that had pressed strongly against his. It's true that they hadn't been alone again, but even so he hadn't rediscovered in her gaze the light on the emptiness that had preceded that moment of violent passion, a request for union that is always a true kiss.

Daniel got out of the shower and bumped into Flop. The dog yelped. The telephone rang. Leaving large puddles of water on the floor, he grabbed the phone. He heard the voice of Marc, cheerful, almost singing, tell him: "She's coming, Nicole is coming and Laurencine hasn't made too many objections."

Daniel sat on the bed. He felt joy and annoyance and didn't know how to separate them, how to remove them and analyze them rationally, as if two flavors were confusing his palate, offending his sense of smell.

He said, "When?"

<!-- Page 56 -->

"Friday, in Nice, on the 5:20pm flight from Orly. Are you happy, Daniel?"

Marc's voice was always more festive, and Daniel felt more annoyed. He tried to mask it, and said "Thanks Marc, I'll do everything possible for Nicole. Let me make arrangements, then I'll talk to you."

He hung up and felt a deep sadness descend on his shoulders. In his head bounced the kiss of Amalia and the face of Nicole. How would they mix together?

He felt the muzzle of Flop rubbing his calf. The shower water had splashed on the bathroom floor. He recovered from the surprise, looked at the wet bedspread and tried to look at the mirror on the wall. He looked at it and tried to smile. He needed a slap, something that would straighten his back. He needed to get out of this hotel room and not pity himself.

Come on Flop - we're going...

<br/><br/><br/>

He climbed Via Maestra, he liked the colors of the small town, the reds lit by the sun, the browns of the bricks of the austere church, the glossy black of the cobblestones. The lower town, protected, towers not too imposing, piazzas where you can talk from one side to the other without raising your voice too much. Flop ran back and forth, as if he wanted to make sure his presence was known, and Daniel remembered that in Bergolo he hadn't wanted to get out of Luciano's car, as if afraid of being abandoned. Daniel made sure he heard his voice, urged him to run, then called him back. He thought that maybe he should buy him a collar, that it would give him security. He paused, smiled to himself, and wondered, security for whom?

He arrived at the *Tastevin*, the door was ajar, he asked permission and entered into the soft shadows of the room. Sitting at a table against the wall, he saw the soft curve of Amalia's back. She had before her a half-full glass of wine. He slowly went and sat in front of her. She had a handkerchief clenched in her fist, and her eyes were still red from crying. Daniel reached for her hand but she took it from the table to the safety of her lap.

"Something serious?"

Amalia shook her head no, then stopped to look at him with angry eyes. 

"I had a fight with Giulio. Because of you."

Daniel shrugged his shoulders, and with his finger stroked the wineglass. She looked at him sternly.

"Don't you understand?"

Daniel shook his head. No, he did not understand. He said "Maybe things were said to you that I don't know."

"Yes, things were said that you don't know, but I'll tell you..." answered Amalia, moving her hand  towards the glass that Daniel, stretching his, held onto. Their fingers brushed and Daniel noticed that her nails had lost some of the pink enamel that had impressed him a few days before.

"I told him that I wanted to restore Ginotta."

Daniel looked at their fingers resting on the glass, getting closer and closer, without reaching each other.

"And you know what he told me? That it was because you'd talked to me. That for years he'd insisted that it be done, and it was because a stranger, a wine taster, said it to me that I agreed. You understand? As if I don't reason with my head and that I need you, who I don't even know, to change my mind."

Amalia was furious, she tried to grab the glass, Daniel held it on the table. Her little finger touched him, he felt a tremor. She looked at him angrily, and tried to grab the glass. Daniel didn't give in, and he looked at her sweetly.

"I arrived at this decision myself. I don't need advice from anyone. As if I hadn't already done so all these years..." 

Amalia's hand returned to the glass, slowly this time, almost pleading, and Daniel let go.

Amalia emptied it and let it fall on the table. Daniel grabbed it to stop it from falling on the floor, straightened it, and left his open hand on the table, the palm upward. [Amalia supported hers with it](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#amaliasupported), closing it into a fist.

Daniel asked, "Where is Giulio now?"

"I haven't seen him since yesterday, he's disappeared."

Amalia cried, silently. Flop came and licked the hand that remained in her lap. Daniel felt her fist pressing into his hand, as if it wanted to disappear.
