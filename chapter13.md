They again passed through the tunnel and went down to Limone, then to Madonna dell'Olmo, towards Cuneo, from there crossing through Fossano, Cervere and Bra, then reached the main road to Alba.

Ahead of them Daniel and Nicole were quiet, watching them you could tell there was no tension, they alternated between dialog and serene silence.

Giulio seemed to be tense: as they were approaching Alba, he was unnecessarily changing gears, accelerating and braking, coming up to the bumper of the car driven by Nicole and then veering suddenly into the center of the road. Floriana asked him if he was getting tired, if he wanted to let her drive. Giulio hadn't responded.

"Why not call your sister?" Eta Beta asked casually, stretching out more and more in the back seat, as if he wanted to disappear, increasingly wrapped up in the collar of his coat and the long red scarf. He looked at the meager mulberries along the road, at the first frost that embroidered the brambles along the ditches like an invitation to a future spring, at the colorful sheds, machine shops, gas stations and tractors, at the mowers with their warm colors of red, blue, and orange like giant toys, with their silver logos on the hoods and sides. 

He saw a light mist obscuring the first shadows of evening and descending from the hills sleeping in their long winter's rest, [and imagined the contrast of working the earth below the great plains and the vineyards high above to keep alive the upcoming season of spring colors that would arrive, when the story already would have had the time to take another direction](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#immaginava).

"If she doesn't hear the phone, send her a text. Warn her that you're returning. After all, like it or not, that's what you're doing."

Giulio turned to look at Eta Beta. "And if she calls me?"

"She won't, but she will be calmer, and this will allow her to have an even stronger reaction when she sees you, but much shorter."

"You don't know my sister..." answered Giulio.

Eta Beta shrugged and turned his gaze towards the seat as if he wanted to fall asleep, or to look for a silence where a solution to the story could be found.

"Are you quarreling with your sister?" asked Floriana. "It seemed to me you were very close, from the few times I saw you when I visited the *Tastevin*."

"I have a friend on the Atlantic Ocean that has Pedro Ximinez grape vines on the Rio Negro, in Argentina. I wanted to go there."

"And you can't cultivate some vineyards here, without going so far away?" Floriana asked. 

"Tell that to my sister. Although now it no longer matters... [it's done](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ormailhofatta)."

He finished his sentence with tight lips, his hands gripping the steering wheel, passing Nicole's car with a sharp acceleration.

At seeing herself passed, Nicole, after her initial astonishment, sped past them in turn, laughing. Floriana saw Daniel hit Nicole on the shoulder to get her to slow down. The girl obeyed, then the two cars slowed down. Giulio, handing her the phone, asked Floriana if she could type in a new message, *I'm coming back*. Floriana wrote that phrase, so brief and so fraught with expectation, then handed the phone back to Giulio, who sent the message.

"It's done," said Giulio, breathing deeply. 

They had passed Cinzano and Biglini, in the distance the red towers of Alba were already appearing, and Eta Beta seemed to come out of his stupor. He said, "Let me out in front of the bus plaza, near the courthouse," in a tone that didn't invite further questions. 

Giulio and Floriana looked at each other, and Floriana said, "I have to get my car back." 

Giulio asked, "What do I do?"
<br/> <br/> <br/>

They ate at the *Savona*. Nicole and Daniel said but a few words about Eta Beta, Nicole had asked where that funny character had disappeared to, wrapped up as if it were winter, but she was soon distracted by the attentions of Daniel and those of Silvio, who, sensing the importance of their guest, was constantly at their table offering something delicious, and then coming back to ask if they "enjoyed it."

Giulio seemed undecided whether to get involved in the cheerfulness of the table, [or to keep to himself and disappear completely](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cadereinsestesso). He had come to Daniel, halfway through dinner, telling him, "[Things in life are settled](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#lecosesiaggiustano)." [Those words were brought on by the dismissive attitude with which Silvio had treated him](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#avevanosollevato).

Just an hour before he would have liked to also get out with Eta Beta at the bus stop and disappear, again, as he had done that evening when he had wagered half of Ginotta. But now he felt refreshed, maybe because of the Grignolino they were drinking, fresh raspberry, currant, and pepper, giving him a desire for revenge, a need to put things back on track. He just had to get past meeting with Amalia.

Giulio looked at Daniel: he was too busy with his daughter to have a thought for his sister, and this bothered him. All that affection hurt him. He too needed affection, and he had gambled it in that stupid game with Baravalle.

Giulio coughed and looked at the empty room. He didn't want to fill it with memories. He looked at Floriana, thinking that the Japanese could also be attractive, and instinctively put his hand on her leg, more to find warmth than anything else, and she didn't seem surprised by the pressure. She turned to him with a look that seemed helpless.  "I'm [*onabe*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#onabe), sorry," she said to him, "and my name isn't Floriana. I'm Maria." Then she discreetly turned back to join in the conversation with Nicole and Daniel. 

Giulio didn't understand what she'd said and tried to focus on the plate of roast beef in front of him. He didn't want to eat meat, suddenly everything caused him irritation. The laughter of Nicole with Daniel, the looks that Floriana or Maria directed to Nicole while she handed her a small lamb chop. He couldn't bear that cheerful intimacy with its tangle of words, glances, smiles. He felt strange, like he was trapped in a thorny and uninhabitable limbo. He jerked, got up from the table, and started across the room, but the entrance was blocked by the noisy company of Baravalle, who, as soon as he saw him, said in a mocking voice, "Here he is, the great gambler."

Giulio retreated to Daniel's table. 

"We thought you were gone forever, Giulio" Baravalle prodded him, "away from your little sister. And instead you're back. Perhaps to gamble away the other half? Right, but you can't. That's tightly held by Amalia, but in time she'll meet with me. I should marry her for the community property." 

Baravalle ended his speech with a coarse laugh and walked to a table far from them.  It was at that point that Giulio flew at him, taking him from behind, pounding him with his fists.

"Anytime," he shouted, "whenever you want, sit down at the table, you bastard. Sit down so I can recover the Ginotta. Right away."

Daniel had rushed into the fray, while Baravalle's friends were pulling Giulio away.

"What do you want to gamble, you asshole... you don't have anything but the clothes you're wearing," shouted Baravalle, adjusting the shirt that had come out of his pants, while Daniel put himself between them.

"Easy... calm down," Daniel said, spreading his arms out. 

"Here he is, [the nose wart](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ilnasodanatta), the Frenchman who was digging in our vines... but go back to Champagne... and you asshole, come back with cards in hand. Or disappear!"

Baravalle and his friends went to sit down, noisily, at their table, while Daniel went to the exit with Giulio, who was visibly dejected.

"Shall I take you home?" asked Daniel.

Giulio shook his head: "I have to go alone," he said.

"Amalia is waiting for you," Daniel said, "and no matter what she says to you, let her say it..."

He patted him on the back and gently pushed him outside, into the night that had become warm, and perfumed with chocolate.
