"Can I go with you?" Nicole had asked.

Daniel had nodded: "If I don't look at you, if I don't see you, you'll understand. Ok?" He had stroked her cheek, smiling, and added: "I had said to myself, a few peaceful days in Piedmont with my Nicole... and you're seeing a casino..."

"Dad... reclaim the farm, and then we can have a magnum of Coca-Cola..."

Daniel smiled at her and sniffed the sleeves of his shirt and jacket. He rubbed his nose and swallowed. He felt odorless and had a clean palate.

"Bottles instead of cards. The Frenchman instead of you. And I bring the bottles. [If the Frenchman ends up in the shit hole, you have to abandon Ginotta](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#bucodelculo)."

So it was expressed by Baravalle and Amalia had accepted. "You have no responsibility," she had said to Daniel, "I have an opportunity, I entrust it to you. It's the only one we have. One card, come what may."

Daniel would have preferred that Amalia take her share of the responsibility and [felt bitter about temperaments that couldn't make concessions](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#amareggio).

"There is responsibility and I feel it," he had responded to Amalia, "you didn't remove it simply by saying that it isn't there, or that it's yours alone..."

She had smiled: "I know... [but you've got it if it ends well](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#macelhai). That's what I wanted to say."

Daniel knew that was what she meant, but it was the way things were being said that mattered. He remained silent. They were walking on the side of the road past *Tre Stelle*, towards the junction leading to Neive, it was mid-afternoon and the wind rose up from the valley floor, moistened by the Tanaro river. She had to contact Baravalle and propose a way out of the impasse.

"Do you want to ruin your life?" he had asked.

"For me, it's fine. I think I have time. Close the *Tastevin* and then decide: [you on that land is out of my mind](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ciesci), believe me."

Baravalle had laughed but believed them, and the cards were switched to bottles: it was up to Daniel to do the strip-tease, he had to strip them bare, like an x-ray from Molinette Hospital.

"How do you feel about it, Daniel?" Amalia had asked. And Daniel had said that he could try, but inside he thought, wistfully, [that it was easier for him, usually, to undress a bottle than a woman](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#chenonunadonna).

"I can try: on the quality of the wine or how it's made I shouldn't have much trouble. He'll try to trip me up on vintages and producers."

They had gone round to the wine bars of Alba, Canale, and Cortemilia, and Daniel had studied the banners and labels of the winegrowers, more to indulge Amalia than out of conviction: there wasn't enough time for all the wine he had to look at and drink. Baravalle had said they would meet in three days, in the lobby of the *Giardino* Hotel.

"Then I'm going with you. I promise not to distract you. I'll stay in the back. I also told Maria: let's go bring him luck."

"Did he put it down in black and white?" Luciano had asked, taking him to the location of the challenge. 
<!-- Page 142 -->

Daniel had laughed: "But yes, there are the labels to talk about. He'll provide them ahead of time."

"Not trusting him is better, however."

Silvio had said the same thing to him, when they were coming down to the reception to wait for Luciano to take them there. "Entrust the labels to some honest man. Baravalle is a bad loser."

Daniel had nodded without stopping to explain that that part would be seen to by Amalia and Giulio, it was their task to take precautions and guarantee it. [He would take only what he had](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#luiciavrebbe). And also: whatever good that Bacchus or whoever would offer him.

The air was warm and aromatic, he detected the scent of peach and would have preferred the previous winter with its patches of snow to stifle the flowering of the apples, the air pristine before the outbreak of spring. He hoped at least that [the bottles had rested at room temperature](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#atemperatura).
