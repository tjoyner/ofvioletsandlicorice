There were even more people the next night, and many were local, as if the 'designer' wines and [those talked about](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thosetalked) from California, Chile, and Uraguay, which had the names of the reds of Piedmont, Veneto, and Tuscany, in the first case had aroused curiosity and in the second case some discomfort, some concern. For this reason Daniel had emphasized the essential marriage between the vines and the earth, and of the importance of the crus and of the [sor&igrave;](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#sori). He tried to give reassurance: it was not enough to be a good winemaker to make an exceptional wine; maybe a good wine, yes, but certainly not one of those that went to Sukiyabasshi Jiro in Tokyo, Le Cirque in New York or to Bocca di Bacco in Berlin.

The next evening was dedicated to French wines, for Daniel a walk in the park, although he expected some disputes, and some local pride also. He would try to smooth that over, as he always did, especially in the case of guests who were distinguished and courteous.

"Why not stay for another week?" Amalia has asked, just as he finished his tasting.

They were sitting near the entrance. Daniel had asked for a salad and some cheese. He looked at Amalia who was playing with a breadstick, and who was slightly flushed after asking him to stay.

"I wouldn't know what to talk about other than boring technicalities."

Amalia remained silent, and had poured a finger of the Roero, as if to take courage.

"We had a nice audience, at least a couple of nights they were good..."

He kept his eyes down on the blue and white checkered tablecloth. Daniel looked at the breast that was moving like a small wave, the kind that will make air bubbles on the last shore. He felt a shiver down his spine. He said, "Amalia, you make me think."

"Thank you for today," she said.

They stayed quiet for a few minutes, then she said "There's a full moon in Ginotta tonight. Do you want to go for a short walk?"

Daniel nodded and said "A few steps would also be good for Flop."

He finished eating the salad and a bit of castelmagno cheese, and drinking his glass of Nebbiolo, while Amalia was conversing with some customers.

Daniel got up and went to the front door to smoke a cigarette. Flop was hopping up and down, sniffing the walls. With a peach-colored cape, Amalia appeared in the doorway of the *Tastevin*.

"Shall we go?" she said.

They reached the car and took the ring road to Altavilla. They reached Ginotta, there was a moon over Guarene that sent flares to Isolone, down to the valley floor. The farm took the paleness of the moon on the south side, on the side of the vineyard, and sank into the dark north with a gloomy aspect.

"It's so sad," said Amalia, getting out of the car.

"I saw the vines clinging to the Elm, which is recovering, there's a lot to replant...but the job is possible," Daniel said, "as long as we want to do it."

This time Amalia had not turned away. She looked down, and whispered "Perhaps it is doable." Daniel reached out, opened his hand, then he realized that he was about to caress her face and felt a shyness. He closed his hand into a fist and dropped his arm to his side. Amalia smiled at him, and said, with a shine in her eyes: "I don't need paternal caresses." He was dumbfounded, unable to answer. Then she came up boldly and putting her hands on his hips, pulled him against her, looking into his eyes, then kissed him on the mouth: a long, warm kiss.

"Changing taxis, eh? I don't know if I blame you."

Luciano opened the door for Daniel, outside of the *Savona*.

"It's always the same, it seems there's just you to use as a taxi driver, in Alba."

"[Here everyone uses rental cars, between Ferrero, World, The Miroglio](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#hereeveryone). And the most economical is a Mercedes 600. What can I do if they don't pick up the crumbs..."

"Me, would I be a crumb?"

"With respect, I was speaking in generalizations." Then, changing the subject, Luciano asked, "Where would you like to go?"

"To see a little of the Barolo area."

"Monforte d'Alba, Novello, Barolo, La Morra, Roddi, Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga... [the tour isn't complete, but that's the idea](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thetourisnt)... and then let's say, a beautiful view of the vineyard hills and you've seen it all..."

Daniel laughed "You are best calling card for The Office of Tourism."

"No, it's that I can't take all of this wine rhetoric any more. We have only that and we build castles of lies. And there's no place for anything, for a memory. We all seem born gentlemen since this is no longer a land of ruin."

"This is good thing," said Daniel, who wanted to think about his own issues.

"I don't deny it, but to forget it is to forget the pain of so much blood shed. These were hills of blood, before wine. And instead of keeping silent, who wants to remember it? Here on April 25 we celebrate with <em>Go Wine</em>, and the Cervere Leeks in the church square more than the fall of the resistance. Since there's no more struggle, there's no more memory."

<!-- Page 48 -->
"Forgetfulness serves to move forward, [to put things right](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#toputthings)."

"It'll happen, but I don't like it."

From the valley floor they rose up towards Barolo, through pastel vineyards, row after row, spacious, straight lines as even as a musical score, a spatial geometry that was becoming more abstract, as the taxi, skirting the Cannubi, rose toward La Volta, breaking away from the ground in a hypnotic vision.

He looked away from the view and thought of the kiss he'd received, the night before, from Amalia. It had something of violence, of rapacity, that covered tenderness and sweetness. He'd been troubled, almost unable to react, to answer her with equal intensity, even if he would have wanted to. They had remained motionless in the yard, then she said, heading for the front door, "Can I ask you to leave the car in Piazza *Savona* and the keys in the hotel, Daniel?"

Daniel had returned to the hotel dazed, and he continued to be as he thought that after the kiss she hadn't even used the familiar "tu", even if the way in which she'd said his name was gentle.

He asked, "What's the relationship status of the Giacosa siblings?"

Luciano shrugged his shoulders.

"He's extremely jealous of his sister, morbidly. She isn't going out with anyone here. [She has sent away more than one, and those who have more real estate and vineyards than her](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#shehassent). Travels, sometimes. [But always comes back like she started](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#butalwayscomesback). Giulio is one of the prostitutes, I would say, or some foreigner in transit. There was a time when there was an understanding with a German, people who had bought in the Langhe believing it was paradise. Two winters of fog and ice where enough to make them disappear. And it all ended there."

Daniel didn't comment. He said "Land rich in limestone, sandstone, here the vines reach great depths..." Maybe he wanted to say that feelings and passions had obscure origins. 

He'd decided to stay, extending the course wasn't a problem. He could possibly talk about white wines, bottling, [the demand for *grappas*](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thedemandfor) and also, the thing he thought most superfluous, the pairing of wine and food. And now that he'd decided he felt relaxed, nothing seemed like a problem, things would go as they would go, both with Amalia, and with Nicole if she decided to join him.
