"This is Marc," said the voice on the other end of the handset.

Daniel looked at the time. It was 8. He had a headache. Back at the hotel the night before, after telling Maria that he'd see her at the *Tastevin*, he'd stopped to talk to Silvio. He'd offered him a Levi grappa &ndash; it was rough. It had felt like young acacia thorns, and now his throat burned. Or perhaps it burned simply because he had drunk too much of it.

Then he'd gone up to his room, where he'd tried to call Marc. He hadn't reached him and left a message. 

"Please, let me drink a little water, Marc..."

Daniel went into the bathroom, rinsed his mouth and washed his face, then he picked up the phone, with a slight anxiety.

"I'm listening."

"We found Nicole. She's all right, she's in the hospital with Vincent. [One week and we put her back on her feet](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#oneweek)..."

"Ok, and after?"

Marc remained silent.

"In a week it will be like before... I'll have her put in rehab."

"Laurencine would let you do that?" asked Marc.

No, Daniel knew, she wouldn't allow it. That, too, was a way to blackmail him, to make his life impossible.

<!-- Page 24 -->

"Help me convince her, Marc, to come here. I could extend my stay, tour Piedmont, maybe go to Tuscany, go to the Veneto. Take her out of Paris, take her out of the loop. Help me Marc, put her on a plane or on a train: Nice and Turin aren't far away."

"...Without asking Laurencine about it?"

"We can always tell her that [it was a sudden decision](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#itwasasudden), Marc."

"You know it's not believable..."

"In the meantime, Nicole will be here, with me."

"Let me think about it"

"Thanks, Marc"

Daniel went to the bathroom to take a shower, then went down and asked for strong coffee.

"Isn't that a risk for your palate?" asked Silvio.

"If it's not hot enough to burn..."

"[The coffee overpowers the flavors](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thecoffee)."

"I never drink it before tasting wine... but even if I did I could feel what I was drinking," Daniel answered him, smiling.

"I was told that you were good."

Daniel shrugged his broad shoulders, as if to shrug off the compliment.

"Is the car here?" he asked, while blowing into his cup. 

The night before, coming back, he'd asked if it would be possible to get a car for the next day. He wanted to tour Barbaresco, Neive, Mango, go up to see some of the vineyards, stop at some wine bars, look at some labels, sample some wine. Smell other odors.

"I told Luciano half-past nine. He'll be here in a minute."

Daniel put the room key next to the cup of coffee and went out. On the steps of the *Savona*, he felt a bump in his legs and turned to look at what had hit him. It was a small black and white dog, a mutt with a short snout and a long, straight tail. After bumping him, it continued to revolve around his legs, rubbing against him, with its tongue hanging out.

<!-- Page 25 -->

"Quite affectionate," Daniel said, bending down to pet it. The dog licked his hands, then began to jump in front of him.

"Are you hungry? Are you lost? Where's your master?" 

He was about to return to the hotel to ask for a piece of bread, when he saw the taxi arrive.

"Found a companion?"

Luciano got out of the taxi. The dog jumped on Daniel and Luciano. 

"Is it lost?"

"Or it was abandoned," Luciano said, touching its lean belly, "likely it was left in the piazza because it wasn't a good truffle dog."

The little dog, after sniffing Luciano, had returned to crouch between the legs of Daniel.

"What do we do?" he asked.

"Get in the car and go."

Luciano closed the door and put the car in gear. Daniel followed him reluctantly. They headed to the ring road, and took the roundabout to Altavilla, but had to stop at the railroad crossing.

"The train's going by," said Daniel, sighing.

"Locals...no more than 3 or 4 a day..."

Daniel heard a scratching at the door. He opened it: it was the small black and white dog again, which quickly jumped inside the car.

"There he is. Now there are three of us."

The crossing gate had risen. Luciano accelerated, jolting the car on the rails.

"Keep it down, so the seats don't get dirty."

But the dog seemed to have already guessed Luciano's order, because it was crouched between the seat and Daniel's feet. They went through Pertinace and began towards Barbaresco. The road climbed in tight corners between walls of thick vines that seemed to slip into the low, milky, sky.

<!-- Page 26 -->

"Yesterday evening was a success. It's not easy here, where wine is like oil, and everyone has to do it better than everyone else. But you're French, therefore they recognize you as an authority, but also show a mixture of awe and impatience. Here, except for some sacred names like Mascarello, Gaja, and Ratti, we've only relatively recently learned how to make wine that doesn't burn the stomach."

"Don't exaggerate," said Daniel, "in France they're more traditional, but here, from you, in Italy, there's more innovation, more invention."

"Regarding inventive, we are inventive. Here in Langhe, everything's invention. We're always inventing. We invented the Langhe, a paradise of vineyards for lovers of wine, and tourists.  'Come to the paradise of Langhe. Great food, great wine, hills that are the envy of Tuscany.' All bull. Here you don't know what to do except eat and get drunk, if you can afford it. Otherwise you can go see a couple of games of *pallone elastico*, hoping they are properly rigged, or be drowned in the fog that bites you from mid-October onward. Or escape..."

Daniel was beginning to understand why the taxi driver, Luciano, as he seemed to be called, only drank beer.

He asked "What kind of people are the Giacosa?"

"You mean Amalia? Beautiful woman, wild..."

"I meant both of them," Daniel emphasized. 

"They are orphans. The father had a horrible death in the vineyard, taken by lightning. Then the mother left shortly after of a broken heart. They came out on their own. She, Amalia, was a mother to Giulio, and never married. They had resources, sold some of their countryside property, now have lodgings, shops, the *Tastevin*. And also land, Ginotta, abandoned... a vineyard on the Barbaresco ridge that's the envy of those in the know."

<!-- Page 27, top -->

"They don't have the ways of those who plant vineyards," said Daniel.

"[Whatever that is](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#whateverthat), no one here has the ways of the farmer, with the rare exceptions of the old, young ecologists, the greens, and those nostalgic for Slow Food. The rest is chemistry and mechanics in the hands of winemakers, technicians, advertisers, and international representatives."

"It's like that everywhere: wine is an industry. How do you stick out," Daniel said petting the dog, which returned the caress by licking the back of his hand.

They arrived at the fork to Neive. 

"Would you like to go up to Mango? First I'll show you where the vineyards are planted now, then others on the banks of the Tanaro. The insides of old churches."

Luciano slowed the car and took a dirt road, stopping after a few hundred meters. He got out, Daniel and the dog followed him. Luciano slipped between the rows, and Daniel and the dog walked parallel to him. After 30 meters they came to a wall of old stones, went around it, and came out on the portico of a church.

"It's from the 12th century, but if you don't already know that, you can't see it, and there's no one to tell you. Inside it's decorated with frescoes and [it's where they keep the tools](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#itswhere)."

Daniel tried to look through the cracks running through the wood of the door.

"It also has a small bell-tower on the other side, hidden by poplars," Luciano said, sitting down on a step and pulling out his cigarettes.

"I guess you don't smoke. A question of the palate..."

Daniel shrugged and reached for Luciano's pack.

"But no," he said, "I just don't abuse it... and then there are so many senses."

"Yours must not be an easy profession... to recognize all the flavors in a wine... it would drive anyone mad."
<!-- Page 28 -->

Daniel lit the cigarette, through a light wind that moved the vine leaves. The dog was curled up between Daniel's feet, his long tail lying on the clay ground.

"Here, too...  they tell a lot of stories. I remember one time two of my colleagues were tasting a bottle of Bordeaux. They found all the flavors possible, then one of them said that he tasted iron, and the other said he'd tasted leather. They went on, affirming and denying. It ended there. But a year later it was learned that a key tied to a leather cord was found in the barrel that the bottle came from."

"If it's true: fine noses and fine palates. If it isn't: equally as good..." said Luciano, putting out the cigarette between his fingers and tossing it in between the rows. "Here at Sottimano they make a good Barbaresco."

Daniel stood up, followed by the dog, walking, brushing the leaves, leaning on the ground, ripping up some grass, listening with his nose to scents and smells.

"I'd like to sit in a bar...  can we go to Mango?" said Daniel, climbing into the car, followed by the dog. 

"[In the bars there's a return to drinking wine, anything but soft
drinks](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#inthebars). Like they used to..."

Climbing uphill, they crossed hazelnut groves, clean as a billiard cloth. Rectangles of corn, vines low and dense. The entrance to Mango looked like a construction site, with cranes and scaffolding for cleaning the facade, fixing cracks in the old walls.

"The Germans returned in peace... [but mostly in Langhe no one looks at anyone's appearance](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#butmostly). It's the wallet that sings."

At the bar in the piazza, Luciano ordered a Poretta beer and Daniel asked for a glass of Sottimano Cott&agrave;.

"Speaking of Sottimano, I believe I've made a discovery... ask for a bit of castelmagno cheese, it'll accompany it well."

Daniel smiled, and said "Why don't the Giacosa siblings take care of Ginotta? Is it a vineyard?"

"A farm above Elvio, below Madonna di Como, there are hectares of vines [along the river](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#alongtheriver). There, lightning took their father during a summer storm. Since then Amalia no longer wants to touch the land, and she's also stopped her brother, who instead wanted to restore the vineyard and the farm... women, when they get an idea in their heads, it sets like cement..."

Daniel slowly drank his glass of Barbaresco, picking at pieces of seasoned Murrazzano [toma](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#tomasorabrus).

"When a place is home to bad memories, it takes time..."

"It's been more than twenty years now."

Daniel threw a piece of cheese to the dog, who sniffed suspiciously before eating it.

"The truth is that Amalia feels responsible for the death of her father," said Luciano, lowering his voice and leaning slightly towards Daniel.

Around them were silent tourists, foreigners: English, Germans, sipping wine the color of ruby and ash from their Riedel glasses.

"What do you mean?" Daniel asked with curiosity. 

"On that night of rain, Attilio was outside looking for his daughter in the vineyard. It was there that the lightening struck him."

"And she feels guilty?"

"So I've been told..."

It was noon, the church bells rang. 

"I have to go," said Daniel.

"Should we leave the dog?" said Luciano, taking the receipt.

Daniel shook his head and stroked the beast, who had rested his muzzle on his shoe.

"Let's try to find him an owner..."

"[One's already been found, I think](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#iftheresone)."
<br/><br/><br/>

"[One assesses a wine using chemistry to identify its constituents](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#oneassesses), while tasting records our reactions to and the interactions between those components."

This was the lesson Daniel liked least, all theoretical, abstract, but he inevitably moved on to practical examples.

"Wine is recognized by its color, its smell, and naturally, its taste. Thus: remembering similar experiences, tasted previously. The wine is first 'dressed' in a white crystal glass so you can look at it. And as you would never admire a rose in the shadow, so a glass of wine should be looked at with a natural light, the best is sunlight, or, as we are doing now, that of a candle, on a white background."

Daniel had returned to the *Tastevin* to face the 19 for the second lesson. He'd found Giulio waiting for him. He had the dog with him, who'd been kept in the courtyard of the wine-bar. As in the *Savona*, with Silvio, he knew by Giulio's look upon seeing the mutt that he should have worked out an agreement, but he couldn't leave it behind. 

Daniel felt that they had an increased number of participants for this talk, compared to the previous evening: local faces, stern rural faces, and gentlemen of excessive elegance for the place and time.

"Let's say that there are some red wines, and we're going to see that it's red, let's say that some wines are less red, ros&eacute;s, and then say that there are whites. But no, they aren't white, but green, yellow, and gold, and which green, and which yellow, and which shade of gold. We talk about colors, but the wines are changing, they are alive, their color can never be steady, sharp. Have you heard of the basic colors? Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet are the basic colors of wine, from their encounters and intersections arise shades. 

"From the uniform green buds in July begins the maturation and coloring of wine [under the play of time](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#undertheplay), under the sky, and then it continues in the barrel. For the reds: from blue to violet, from violet to red, red to purple, from purple to orange, from orange to brick red. For whites: from green to yellow, from yellow to amber, from amber to gold, from gold to brown."

Daniel paused, raised his glass to the candle light and rotated it slowly, letting the legs leave their soft arches on the inside of the 'Piemontese.' He was working with a Barolo, and he looked at the crowd. They were attentive, they spoke softly. He had them. Daniel lifted his glass to his nose. He inhaled slowly. 

"The smell justifies this protuberance that we call the nose and the odors can be good or bad, weak or strong. In wine there is never a unique smell, but a group that you call bouquet. The bouquet will change over time. The primary one is composed of the original aroma of certain qualities of wine, think of Moscato. The secondary bouquet is created by enzymes that work to transform the juice into wine. It is then that they emerge and blend the aromas of peach, apricot, plum, raspberry and rose, violet, iris, lily of the valley, peony, carnation. And then we come to the third stage of aromas, the finish, where the aromas of wild game, wild berries, and earthy humus settle into the wine."

Daniel took a sip of wine, held it a moment in his mouth, then spit it into a bowl.

"The taste," he said, "has a few notes: you feel the sweet, the salt, the bitter, the sour, and they're assisted by the aromas, as well as the taste buds in the back of the tongue that feel the bitter acid in the center and the edge, the sweet on the tip, while the salt is felt on the side near the borders with the sweet zone.

"We could also talk about the feel, because a sip of wine relaxes, like a cloth, a tissue, on the tongue. A feeling, overall, of body, structure, personality, that we listen to, because the wine tells a story of place, of time, of man's labor, of civilization."

Daniel had finished. He made arrangements to meet the following evening and received a round of convincing applause. Now he wanted to go into the yard, smoke a cigarette and see how the dog was behaving, but he was approached by one of those present, a tall, handsome man, with crew-cut hair and the face of someone who lives outdoors. Without introducing himself, he asked, "How was the wine that you tasted?"
<!-- Page 32 -->

Daniel looked at him, he wasn't trying to provoke him, the eyes of his interlocutor were clear, sincere, and sure. A professional?

Daniel took up the glass, slowly swirling the liquid, and just wet his lips. He remembered it well. He said, "Garnet red color, hints of orange zest. You know, I would say, toasted hazelnut, licorice, white truffle, dried mushrooms with a base of tobacco." Daniel paused, looked at his interlocutor, looking for a smile. There was none. He continued, "Well structured, velvety, vital. In summary, a good '82 Barolo Ratti."

The smile came. "Bravo, I couldn't have said it better myself, although I would have added to the smell of tobacco that of wild animal."

He gave him a light clap on the shoulder with his wide hand and walked away. Giulio stopped him at the door, while Daniel went out the back and was greeted by a shy dog's barking.

"Do you have a name?" he asked, taking his head in his hands. "And what would it be, and how can we find it out?"

"So many questions. [Everything isn't about wine](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#everythingisnt)..."

The voice came to him from behind with a tone that was firm and calm. Daniel turned around. It was Amalia, holding in one hand a bottle from the tasting and two glasses that she placed, passing Daniel, on a small round table made of stone.

"Would you like a slice of salami, or would you prefer a piece of cheese?"

"Is it possible to have both?"

Daniel heard her laugh, a restrained laugh from the throat, as he had imagined, a bit youthful, [that answered and satisfied his intuition](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thatanswered).
<!-- Page 33 --> 

Amalia disappeared while Daniel went to sit at the table, followed by the dog that crouched at his foot, again placing his muzzle on his shoes.

"You passed the exam," said Amalia, crossing the courtyard with a platter in hand and going to sit in front of Daniel.

"That would be?"

"That was Martinelli, Massimo Martinelli. The wine is his. He's one of the great Barolo makers here, in Langhe."

Daniel nodded his head in a sign of assent. He knew him by reputation, had read some of his articles on Barolo. He said, "He's also good with Bordeaux."

He looked at Amalia in the faint light filtering through the windows and the door of the *Tastevin* kitchen. The darkness of the night accented her red hair, slightly curled, and emphasized the whiteness of her teeth and the clarity of her gaze.

She was a brusque woman, Daniel thought, who hid a capacity for sweetness. She was wearing a long blue skirt, and a silver silk blouse with mother of pearl buttons so far apart that from time to time a breast appeared between the gaps with a whiteness of snow, a small and tight bow that caught Daniel's gaze in its roundness just below the nipple.

He tried to divert his attention from the white flesh that agitated him. He looked up at her eyes, [which reflected purple in the night](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#whichreflectedpurple).  

Amalia filled the glasses and pushed the tray towards the center of the table. Daniel took a slice of salami and a slice of plain bread. He gave a piece to the dog.

"[What are you going to do with it?](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#whatareyou)?" Amalia asked, taking a sip of wine.

"I haven't the slightest idea... I hoped it would tire of my company, and go back to where it came from."

"Does that happen to you a lot?" she asked with a half smile. 

Daniel shrugged, and thought of Laurencine, Nicole.
<!-- Page 34 -->

"When it's got to happen...,", he replied, returning for a moment to look at that slice of breast that shone like an August moon. Amalia noticed it and straightened her blouse, but without showing any annoyance. She was about to answer him, when out came Giulio.

"There's another full house for tomorrow night, Daniel, you'll see. The 'designer' wines intrigue us almost as much those that come to us from California, Peru, and Uruguay."

"I'm not excited about them, they have little history and sometimes not even land in which to grow."

"They've filled their heads with the first growths. If the Barolo doesn't come from Cannubi they'll turn up their noses. That sucks. They're excited about new wines, inventive, like Gaja makes in Tuscany. And Gaja is the ultimate..."

"I prefer your Barbaresco," answered Daniel, taking a slice of toma cheese.

Amalia was absent from their discussion. Daniel saw her wandering gaze, and supposed that her thoughts were elsewhere. She expressed annoyance at their words, nervously taking slices of salami and chunks of cheese from the platter.

"What do you intend to do with the dog?" Amalia asked again.

"At the *Savona*, I didn't get all these questions..."

"Sooner or later you will."

"Let's go to Ginotta," Giulio said to his sister. Amalia shrugged, to suggest to him that he should go.

"To Ginotta?" asked Daniel.

"Right, the Ginotta is also where he goes on all fours," Amalia said with a mocking tone.

"I don't understand..." Daniel felt embarrassed.

"Two days ago you were there, on all fours under the hazelnut trees in our farm... like a truffle hound."

Daniel laughed, but not so much for the posture in which he had been seen, but for the coincidence. He'd left the taxi driver on the road to Treiso and was on a side path, walking among willows, poplars, and mulberries, until he came upon a riverbank, always listening to the smells with his nose, and ended up in that small grove, under an abandoned farm that now turned out to be the Ginotta of the two Giacosa siblings, who were at that time his employers and the guardians of a distant tragedy.

"Ah, I understand," he said.

"Do you know Ginotta?" asked Giulio, curiously.

"I was there by chance, I wanted to have a look around, breathe the air of the vineyards. Smell some of the odors..."

"That was our farm... it still is... but we don't live there anymore... it's falling apart... but woe to anyone to work it or sell it... my sister..." Giulio didn't finish the sentence, the conversation was difficult in front of a stranger. So thought Daniel as Giulio left the small courtyard and re-entered the bar.

Daniel looked at Amalia, who was again distant, far away. The man got up from his chair, said that it was late, thanked her and made arrangements for the next evening. The woman acknowledged him with a nod. Daniel, followed by the dog, went back into the cone of light from the *Tastevin*.
