"Here's the suitcase. He'll be here soon."

Luciano put the red leather suitcase on the counter and asked Silvio to open a beer. 

"Who?" asked Silvio, rubbing his hand on the worn leather.

"A foreigner, French I think..."

"He doesn't have a reservation," said Silvio, glancing at the register.

"I told him to come to you."

Silvio went out from behind the reception counter and opened the door to the bar.   

Luciano followed him into the dark room. He sat down on a stool while Silvio opened the beer cooler.

"Where's he now?"

Luciano shrugged his shoulders, waiting for Silvio to open the Morettis.

He said, "I left him on the road to Pertinace. I lost sight of him as he walked into a field."

"Who is he?" asked Silvio, cleaning the mahogany counter with a rag.

"I don't know, I picked him up at the train station. He also paid for the return ride, after he asked where the *Savona* was and how to get there."

Luciano took a swig, then took the small bottle and started towards the hotel exit. 

"If he doesn't make it, come back and get the suitcase," Silvio shouted, shaking his head.

"It's a warm spring," answered Luciano, getting in the car.
<br/><br/><br/>

She was at the kitchen window drying an espresso cup when she saw a man emerge from the colors of the hazelnut trees. He came crawling on all fours looking at the ground like he'd lost something. Amalia was curious: the man had broad shoulders, a large, golden-brown head, wide hands and a prominent nose. 

She wondered what he was doing on the ground, there in [Elvio](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#elvio), with his nose in the grass. Was he drunk, maybe, or was he sick? 

Amalia put the cup and towel on the windowsill, left the kitchen, and went down to the yard. The old house was in such a state of abandon that they'd more than once found non-EU refugees&nbsp;and drug addicts there. 

She left by the small side door, crossed the abandoned vegetable garden, and slipped into the hazelnut grove, but couldn't find any trace of him.
<br/><br/><br/>

It was 6 when Silvio saw him arrive.  He came in with an awkward and heavy step, banging his shoulder against the entrance door frame. He was tall and large. He was wearing a hazel colored jacket with baggy blue pants that were stained with dirt up to the knees. Silvio guessed he was the owner of the suitcase that Luciano had brought by and put under the counter. 

The stranger hesitated a moment in the shaft of light coming through the entrance, then headed toward the reception desk. He stopped in front of Silvio and pulled  two tufts of grass out of the pockets of his linen jacket, dropping them on the counter.

"This is chamomile," he said, taking a sprig and passing it under his nose, then offering it to Silvio. Silvio, irritated, sniffed and nodded.

"But what's this? I can't figure it out."

He spoke Italian slowly, softly, with an accent from across the Alps. He had a large nose and light blue eyes with a steady gaze. Under his nose, Silvio found a handful of long and narrow leaves. He recognized it before he smelled it. 

"*Caretta* grass," he said.

"Is it used in wine? In which wine is it used?" the stranger asked him.  

Silvio looked at him with an odd curiosity. He took the grass from his hands and rubbed it on his wrist.

"It's used to clean the barrels," he said, raising his wrist toward that big nose.

The stranger sniffed, then shook his head. 

"Sterile, but you never know. Right?"

He smiled at Silvio, a wide, welcoming smile. Then he picked up the leaves of grass and they disappeared in his pocket.

He asked, "I think you have my suitcase, right? And that you'd like to see my ID?"

Then he added, while fiddling with an inside pocket of his large jacket, "The suitcase is already in the room, right?"

Silvio felt embarrassed, [like he'd let him down](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#mancatodifiducia).

"We don't have many guests; I wanted you to choose the room: whether you prefer on the courtyard, or across from the piazza. It's noisier, but also brighter. How long do you intend to stay?"

The stranger shrugged his shoulders, putting his ID on the counter.

"I don't know. I'm not sure yet... a week, let's say a week. Is that ok?"

Silvio nodded, took the document, filed it in a drawer, and took the red leather suitcase from behind the counter.

"I'll take it," said the stranger. 
<!-- Page 6 -->

Silvio pointed to the steps to the right of the door to the bar. "Do you prefer the first or second floor?"

"The stairs are better for me, I'm overweight. Let's go up..."

Silvio and the stranger went up two flights of stairs and went to the end of the hallway. At the end on the left Silvio opened the door to room 15.

"This overlooks the courtyard." He let the stranger cross to the French doors that overlooked the courtyard. Then he opened the door to room 18, saying: "And from here you can see the piazza..."

The stranger reached it, opened the window and looked toward the ground, toward the cafe and the patio, toward the central garden. 

"The view is pleasant, but the other room's quieter. Unfortunately, I'm a light sleeper."

"It's your choice," said Silvio, shrugging his shoulders and giving him the key. "Are you eating in the hotel?"

"Eating...already, eating," answered the stranger, deep in thought. "Yes, I think it's a good time for it. Thank you." Then he picked up the bag and returned to 15, shutting the door with his shoulder. 

Silvio, curious, hurried down the hallway and went down the stairs, towards the ID card. Who was this guy? 
<br/><br/><br/>


"You want to buy a vineyard? You can't buy any here. No one is selling. Whoever owns the land holds onto it. The last purchase, it was in the Seventies, went to Fiat in Turin, who bought 17 million hectares. Today it's worth 700, 800. Look around: there are many millionaires. While it lasts..." 

He drove slowly through the hills combed with vineyards. He looked in the rear-view mirror, trying to get him to talk, but the stranger didn't seem to have a mouth, nodding his head while he looked around. Luciano was taking him to the *Savona*. Silvio had called him yesterday evening, saying that the Frenchman had asked for him for the morning; he wanted to take a tour of the hills.
<!-- Page 7 -->

He continued, "You don't see anyone working, but everything is as it should be. Not a leaf out of place or a cluster with one grape too many. Who works in the evening or night?" said Luciano, by now more to himself than to his taciturn client.

"Herbicides, tractors, a little bit of chemistry... the fog and the sun do the rest, as long as the ground doesn't wear out..."

They passed the *Tre Stelle* and they turned towards Neive. Luciano swerved slightly, not expecting an answer. He asked: "You're a wine connoisseur?"

"I sample it," was the reply.

"Here it'll be tiresome: the Barbaresco this and the Barbaresco that, the Barolo of this guy and that guy. The vineyard here and the vineyard there. Here everyone's wine is the best in the area, one winery after another. We're becoming, here in Langhe, one big winery: the Ferrari of wine... and also the Ford..."

"But you also make chocolate, soccer balls, clothes..." said the foreigner.
<br/><br/><br/>

Then the man returned to looking outside. The morning was blue and the green colors sharp and straight along the hills, which curled down into each other like clouds, without casting shadows, but only bursts of white light, prunes, pears, and cherries. 

A magpie quickly crossed the road, brushing the hood of the Mercedes.

"If it were a hare I would've gotten it... but they aren't as stupid as cats," said Luciano.

"Poor beasts, all the cars have ruined their hearing," said the stranger.

They started to hear shots in the distance.  

"[Cannons, on Guarene](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#guarene)... here, the weather comes like this: clouds take off from [Monviso or Bisalta](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#monviso) and bring hail. Then it's goodbye to the harvest."
<!-- Page 8 -->

Luciano slowed the car, [they were on a slope](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#incosta). He opened the car window, sticking his head outside, while an intense perfume of linden invaded the inside of the car.

In front of them, on the left, was a bar. Luciano asked, as the car approached the entrance to the lot, "Do you mind if we stop for a moment? I have to take a leak. You can have a coffee or aperitif, my treat."

Luciano climbed the steps and disappeared inside. The stranger slowly got out of the car and followed him. There was no one at the tables and no one behind the counter. They remained standing and looked at the bottles of wine on the shelf, at the black and white photos on the walls: they were all of vineyards, just like those they'd just gone through, but some were sparser and used wooden stakes, and others, more recent, were thick and supported by cement posts. 

He was drawn to a photo of a half-wrecked vineyard, where, in the center, there lay a great cross of Jesus. He went closer to see it better.

"That crazy [Attilio](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#attilio)... [look what his vineyard was reduced to](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#lookwhat)..."

Luciano was in back of the stranger, still buttoning his pants.

"What would you like to drink? I'll take a beer... you?"

The stranger shook his head. He went even closer to the photograph: Christ with his head face down, around him the vines were uprooted.

"It was an ugly night, for everyone. For Attilio the worst, [he lost his mind](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#rimessoilpensiero)."

They heard a voice, and footsteps behind the bar. "Would you like something to drink?"

"Virginio, a beer. The usual Moretti. My client would like to taste your Chardonnay. A small sip would be nice, ok?"
<!-- Page 9 -->

Without waiting for a response, he continued, "Do you remember, Virginio, the storm two years ago? It seemed to have burst from the sky: hail, water, and lightning on the vineyards on the eve of the harvest. And that poor Attilio, who looked at his vineyard reduced to a swamp and rushed to the church, detached the crucifix, and dragged it through Barbaresco, screaming 'Christ, look! Look what you've done, look!', he had gone out of his mind, poor Attilio."

The innkeeper nodded, filling a glass of white. The foreigner took the glass, looked at it, smelled it, and barely wet his lips. He put the glass back on the table, thanked them, and left. Luciano and the innkeeper looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders.

"Suspicious. Or just a teetotaler who's come to the wrong place..."  said Luciano, paying.

"Go, you're not any better, drinking beer," the innkeeper responded, giving him the change.

Then Luciano went out to the piazza, where the stranger was waiting for him, already sitting in the car.

"Wouldn't it have been better to offer an Arneis, a Favorita, or a Blang&egrave; from this area?" he asked when Luciano resumed driving; then he closed his eyes as if he wished to sleep or to wander in his own thoughts.
<br/><br/><br/>

The room was simply furnished, with no wallpaper, painted a lemon tint, with a double bed, a wardrobe made of light wood, and a walnut desk that housed a small TV with a minibar on its side. There was a warmth from the overhead light and lamps. The bathroom, with white and black mosaic tiles, was large with a bath and shower and two large rectangular sinks. There was no shortage of bars of soap, lavender bubble bath, and shampoo. 

Upon entering he was greeted by Silvio with a "welcome back, Monsieur Lorenzi," which took him by surprise, because neither in the morning, when he'd left with the driver, nor during the previous evening's dinner, had he given his surname. He smiled, thinking he'd been promoted to a "guest."

<!-- Page 10 -->
He returned the smile, asked for the key, and said he was going up to the room to make a phone call. Then he'd have breakfast.

He'd tried to call his daughter the night before, without finding her. Nicole wasn't there. His ex-wife Laurencine had answered, which, instead of calming him, had made him more restless. Nicole had gone out in the afternoon and hadn't returned for dinner.

"As a rule," Laurencine had told him, "she comes and goes, a little like you always did."

Daniel had cut her short: the time of fights and accusations, the attempts at explanation had become pointless. The wall between them, despite an amicable separation, had become increasingly high.
<br/><br/><br/>

He dialed the Paris number and waited. The telephone rang a long time. The line went dead. Daniel tried again, in vain. He looked in his address book for the number of Marc's office. Helene, the secretary, answered. "Lorenzi," he said. 
<br/><br/><br/>

Helene replied that she would put him through to the doctor.

"This is Daniel, Marc."

"Everything okay, Daniel?" The voice was calm, reassuring.

"I'm here, in Alba. I can't find Nicole... there's no answer at the house."

"Did you talk to Laurencine?"

"Yesterday... she also didn't know where she was... and now she's not answering."

There was a silent pause, then Marc said: "Daniel, this isn't the first time. I'm worried, but not too much. [At this point there's no way to track her. I promised you that we'll succeed](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#alpunto). [Rest easy](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#resteasy). I'm thinking of her."

Daniel nodded, as if Marc could see him, and put the receiver down before saying thanks. He got out of bed and took refuge in the bathroom, under a hot shower.
<br/><br/><br/>
<!-- Page 11 --> 

He knew, going into the dining room, that this would be his table for his entire stay at the hotel. A small table for two, isolated from the longer tables, near a french door that opened onto a tiny courtyard of hydrangeas, huddled around a large linden tree.

He sat down at the table and was soon joined by Silvio, who offered him a menu.

"I only need a large salad," said Daniel, "and a bottle of non-carbonated mineral water."

"You came to Piedmont for fasting, eh?" Silvio asked cheerfully, [assuming a familiarity that he instinctively knew was possible](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#permettendosi): the Frenchman had a blue gaze and an amiable smile. And in fact, Daniel smiled.

"No no," he said, "it's that I'm a little overweight and I can only do this in the morning. I'll make up for it tonight."

Silvio nodded.

"[But in the salad we use only the herbs that we have... and the seasoning is left to me](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#cimettatutte). We don't use vinegar."

Then Daniel looked around, looked at the faces of the diners: farmers with faces broad and strong, the women very made up, fresh from the hairdresser. He looked at the plates of roasts and red meats, the bottles of wine that Silvio uncorked in front of them, sniffing the cork and then handing it to the customer.

Just like Burgundy, people were eating too much in the morning, even on weekdays. They were winemakers, entrepreneurs, business executives, traveling salesmen, farm equipment vendors: people who still divided the day in two and took their time because they could. Men and women who swirled the wine in their glass with short circular movements whenever they drank, as if there were, in every sip, a shade more to grasp, but it was an affectation, too, thought Daniel, a recent tic. And, in part, people like him were guilty.
<!-- Page 12 -->
<br/><br/><br/>

This was why he'd been called there, to the land of the great reds, of the many great vineyards.
<br/><br/><br/>

Daniel ate the salad with pleasure, appreciating the radish and green pepper, tender carrots, salty capers, small black olives, valerian and endive, cucumber and lettuce heart. He discarded the garlic clove, but appreciated its scent, sweet and dry. He drank half a bottle of fortified mineral water and rose from the table satisfied. He waved as he walked through the tables, took his key from the box behind the counter, and climbed the stairs to his room. He decided to sleep a couple of hours before going to his appointment.
<br/><br/><br/>

Amalia recognized him as soon as he entered the *Tastevin*. He was the clumsy man she'd seen emerge from beneath the hazel trees of Ginotta. She felt an immediate tenderness towards the large figure, awkward, blue-eyed with stiff, reddish hair matted on his broad forehead. He wore a carrot-colored linen jacket, very large, a pair of blue denim jeans, and a pomegranate-red collarless shirt with clear mother of pearl buttons, like those from Provence.

"Giulio," she said to her brother, "the sommelier from Paris is here. You go, I'll be there soon."

The wine bar was empty, it was a couple of hours before opening; in the shadows of mid-afternoon, the slightly ajar window shutters let in rays of light and warmth, combined with the smell of dry straw, linden trees, and smoke from the railroad embankment.

Daniel had crossed the middle of Via Maestra, as Silvio had told him, looking at the men's and women's fashion stores, the jewelers, the delicatessens, and the many windows exhibiting magnum bottle trophies of Barolo and Nebbiolo, of Moscato and [Chinato](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#chinato) wines lying between nougat bars, bags of cornmeal biscuits and jars of floating dried mushrooms with silhouetted cartoons of black and white truffles. Then he found the sign of the enoteca *Tastevin*, knocked, and went in. 
<br/><br/><br/>

"Monsieur Daniel Lorenzi. From Paris, I'd bet..." Giulio left the question open, because the man could only be him, there were letters and phone calls to confirm the date and time of his arrival.

Giulio went to meet him, extending his arm and patting his back in a friendly way.

"You're from Paris, but with an Italian last name, right?"

"I come from Nice. A long time ago... but you aren't Amalia Giacosa..." Daniel replied, with a quick smile, holding out his hand.

Giulio laughed. "My sister, it's she who runs things here. All the ideas are hers, I'm the errand boy: I'm only in charge outside that door. And even then..." 

He said the last sentence without smiling, in a low voice. Daniel pretended not to have heard him. He asked: "Can I have a glass of water?"

He went and sat down with his back to the bar. 

The hand that placed the glass in front of him was white and thin, the fingers long, with light blue veins on the back. The nails, painted pink, were well-groomed and sharp. The fingers let go of the glass with a slow and natural softness, like a caress, leaving fingerprints on the icy glass. Daniel had an impulse to grab the glass, overlaying his big fingertips on those light traces. He resisted and grabbed the Riedel by its pedestal.
<!--Page 14-->

"Don't worry, it's just a San Bernardo." 

The voice came to him, slightly hoarse, from over his shoulder. Daniel turned and rose to his feet. She was tall also, a white smile under two dark eyes with a mass of red curls like autumn vines. She had an athletic body, lean and firm, wore a blue dress with a very high neckline. She wore no necklace or bracelets. She didn't wear a watch. 

"Amalia Giacosa?" he asked, waiting for her to extend her hand. When he felt it in his, it was warm and nervous. He held it for a moment while she said "Sit down, please sit down."

Daniel turned to sit down, took a sip, and watched her through his glass as she sat down in the opposite chair. He thought that he'd rather deal with Giulio. But Giulio was gone.

He said, "So, here I am. I'm ready for the work that awaits me."

"When the time comes, I suggest you sprinkle a few words of French into your excellent Italian. Otherwise, they may think we're trying to fool them with someone other than a sommelier from Paris..."

She got up, offering a smile as bright as the July moon, and Daniel held his breath. 

"You set up wine cellars, or so you've written to me... you prepare them for clients that don't know where to begin, or that don't have the time to follow through..."
  
"Generally for private clients... also a few restaurants. In both cases, I try to select clients that I can work with closely. It's a task that requires trust on both sides."

"What kind of customers do you have?" asked Amalia, interested.

"People from film, theater, television, lawyers. My wife, my ex-wife, is a lawyer. She deals with rights, performance contracts... so I've had the chance to meet many actors, directors, set designers, and even lawyers, who had houses with empty wine-cellars. So..."

"So you filled the cellars for them," said Amalia, her smile breaking down into a half-laugh. 

"No... not filled... I made sure they had the right bottles for every occasion...I hope."

Daniel shrugged his shoulders and looked her in the eye. Amalia shifted her gaze toward the center of the table.

"Ok," she said, "as I wrote, you'll do five nights for us on the Great Wines of France, and I or my brother will bring wines from local producers that interest you. The first event is scheduled for this evening, remember?"

"Monsieur Bordeaux... I remember." Daniel nodded and added, "I have a list of producers who I'd like to meet: Gaja, Mascarello, Ratti, Rabezzana, Ceretto... your big names. In France, it goes without saying, they love Barola, Nebbiolo, Barbaresco and now also Barbera..."
<br/><br/><br/>

"Let's hope it lasts. After September 11th, it wasn't an easy time for wine... or maybe it was all too easy before... too fast."

Amalia had become serious, and on her hands Daniel saw the thin veins become more blue. How old would she be? 35, maybe 40?

He said: "Quality: quality and competence wins over everything." [Then, not having said enough](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#thennothaving), added "And fantasy."

Daniel watched Amalia's hand leave the table and slip into her mass of red hair. 

"Yes, the fantasy..."

She didn't seem convinced, or maybe she was just worried. [She got up from the table as if she wanted him to leave](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#congedare). She said, "Our guests arrive at 9. You, I imagine, will need a little time to get organized. Come whenever you think..."

"Can I ask your brother Giulio to help prepare the decanters?"

Amalia agreed with a [shrug of her shoulders](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#shrugofher), indifferent, as if to say that it was up to him, then walked toward the door behind the bar. Daniel breathed in the scent of linden, while looking at the thick railway embankment &ndash; his grandfather was stationmaster at Villefranche, and he'd never forgotten that smell which gave him a sense of adventure, bewilderment, and surprise. He put the half-empty glass on the table and walked out into the warm air of Via Maestra. 

The girls had discovered the navel. They laughed, walking or sitting at tables along the street crowded with Japanese, Germans, and the English: fond of wine, good food, and the Italian landscape.

Daniel looked at the exposed stomachs and thought about Nicole. It was a freedom that wasn't enough, apparently. The tight tops, the frayed blue jean shorts, the fifty Euros in your pocket, the moped. They weren't goals that gave her enthusiasm or security, she wanted something that neither he nor Laurencine could ever provide: she wanted to dull her senses, that pills and heroin crap. The problem, therefore, was them, the two of them.

For this they had separated, he and Laurencine. Or maybe not, maybe for reasons that had already been built up. Those reasons were the basis of Nicole's confusion. 

He stopped in front of a gelato shop. He felt a sudden desire for something fresh, for vanilla gelato. He got in line and asked for a vanilla cone, so as not to disappoint the boy behind the counter who had offered him 4 or 5 samples. Those girls were beautiful, with their exposed navels and gelato on their lips. But his Nicole was better than that: tall, brunette, with green eyes and full lips, just like her mother.
<!-- Page 17 -->

Daniel started towards the *Savona*, forgetting he had a gelato in his hand.
<br/><br/><br/>

"The French will be center stage, this evening at  the *Tastevin*..." Luciano said sitting at the bar in the *Savona*. A French wine tasting. Do we need that, with all our own wine to drink?"

"Coming from you, who doesn't go beyond Moretti..."

Silvio shrugged, continuing to clean the glasses. "Globalization, Luciano. The French drink ours and we drink theirs. Americans and Germans drink ours and the French."

"And in a little while they'll all drink Californian, Uruguayan, Chilean, and all of them, from here and beyond, [will own our asses](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#nelculo)."

"God forbid..."

"Maybe not God, but the prices, yes."

"Yes, and really Giulio is the first. He reveres [designer wines](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#vinidisegnati)... you know he doesn't give a damn about a good Barbaresco, Nebbiolo or Dolcetto. He likes to call the wine 'Cappuccino,' 'Crest Beak,' '[Point of Light](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#pointoflight),' 'Harlequin,' order grapes, mix, blend: Wine without vines..."

"[You know how Amalia is](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#youknowhow)..."

"[How she's become, Amalia](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#howamalia)."

"[Giulio would like to work the vineyard](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#giuliowould)."

"Yeah, but for Amalia it's a cemetery..."

"[It's still her father, down there: struck down](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#itsstillher)..."

"There's always been death in the vineyard, first with famine, then with the Germans, then with tractors when things got better. Just like going to sea or a factory, Luciano. And, knock on wood: like driving a car."

Luciano asked for another beer. He said, "Isn't it too late to do a tasting [of real French wine](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ofrealfrench)?"

<!-- Page 18 -->
Silvio leaned over. "I agree, it's the first of May. They do tastings in November, October. But you go to find out the commitments, the possibilities. Isn't there air conditioning at the *Tastevin*? The play is always running... at this point, we do theater."

"It's hot for you here," said Luciano.

"We're still in Alba," said Silvio bluntly.

"Yeah... not scattered all over or lost to the world..." said Luciano in return, with the laughter of one who's chosen to drink beer no matter where he is.
<br/><br/><br/>

The evening had gone well. It had been enjoyable. Daniel had done what he called the *three card trick*, an ironic presentation of himself and his profession. Seated at the tables were a dozen people, including a Japanese woman with a body like a mannequin, a very elegant English couple, and a table of Germans who were distracted and a little tipsy. It was aimed at them to get their attention and quiet them down.

With Giulio watching, he had filled twenty glasses with Favorita and twenty with Freisa, then asked the guests to blindfold themselves with their napkins. He'd have them taste a wine, and then ask if they had drunk a white or a red.

The table of Germans was wrong three out of four times, and the other guests didn't do much better. After one taste, the young Japanese woman and the English couple had no doubts. In the end, 13 out of 20 hadn't been able to distinguish a red from a white with their eyes closed, which is how it usually went at a tasting.

The second card that Daniel had thrown on the table was that of the spider web. He had a good young Dolcetto from Ratti in a dirty bottle with cobwebs, and a more modest Dolcetto from Battaglino in a clean bottle, both unlabeled. He asked them to taste and make a judgment about which of the two Dolcettos was better. Almost unanimously, with the exception of the English couple, they chose the Dolcetto in the clean bottle. Daniel was a little disappointed that the beautiful Japanese girl had also stumbled. 
<!-- Page 19 -->

For the third and final card, Daniel had put the same wine in two unlabeled bottles, a white, the Ceretto Blang&egrave;, asking which of the two wines was better. They split almost in half. The English couple turned out to be the winners because they claimed they "didn't know how to choose," thus getting the right answer by default.
<br/><br/><br/>

While going down Via Maestra, passing the lighted shop *Donne Vincenti*, containing delicate silver and black dresses that were draped on the female mannequins, top bargains, and pants with loud stripes, Daniel smiled, inhaling large puffs from the first Gauloise of the day. He recalled the faces of disbelief after he'd said the wines were the same. It was then that he'd seen Amalia appear in the room, hands firmly on her hips and with a smile split between satisfaction and defiance, as if she wanted to tell him that she wouldn't have been deceived. Deceived about what? Daniel asked himself, turning into the *Savona* piazza. About the wine? About what?

The bar was open, he sat under the arcades, there was bustle and merriment, music of an Italian summer translated, like almost everywhere, into American tones.

He asked the waiter for a gin and tonic, light. He'd only had a sip of Burgundy, but he wanted to be alert because he had missed a phone call at the close of his second night away from Paris.

He saw the Japanese girl pass by. He waved to her, half-rising from his chair. She saw him, slowed down, smiled at him. Daniel felt obliged to invite her to the table. With some surprise, Daniel saw that she accepted the invitation, coming over and sitting opposite him.

"My name is Maria Suzuki," she said, awkwardly holding out her hand and bowing her head. "My mother was from Rome."

Daniel took the tips of her fingers in his hand and smiled at her.

"Would you like something to drink?"

"You're French?"

"Yes, would you prefer to speak English?"

"I'm trying to learn about Italian wine. And also the language, which is neither mine nor yours. If we speak Italian maybe we'll understand each other better and also get some practice. Isn't that right?"

Daniel smiled, nodded yes. It didn't seem necessary to explain to her that he'd had an Italian grandfather who was a stationmaster in Villefranche.

"You didn't deceive me with the spider web, you know? I knew before I drank that it was a good wine. I had a grandfather in Osaka who made sake, and he told me that the spider webs protect the quality, the aging..."

Daniel didn't want to talk about wine, and even less about his little tricks. He said, "We live in a society of sexual phobia. A society of cleanliness. It's also clearly important in the cellar, but now a web, unless it's from Spider-Man, makes us shudder today."

Maria laughed, exposing the enamel of her small teeth.

"Can I get a drink?" she asked. 

"Whatever you want..." answered Daniel, beckoning the waiter to come over.

Maria looked him in the eye and asked, "Are you drinking mineral water?"

Daniel shook his head and responded, "No, it's a gin and tonic, light..."

"Same for me," said Maria to the waiter, then turned toward Daniel and asked, "The hard liquors don't ruin your palate?"

Daniel laughed. "80 percent of the time I taste with my nose. With this potato, see? And then I taste for my profession, and drink for pleasure, to remember, to forget, for nostalgia. Who knows... there are many reasons for drinking, right?"

"And also to be happy, or no?"

Daniel looked at her. She was beautiful. Japanese with long legs, a slender torso, her charcoal hair cut in bangs. She might be the same age as Nicole, and this thought disturbed him, but only, or so he wanted to believe, because the thought of Nicole reminded him that he still had a phone call to make before he could consider the day successfully over.

"I like Italian cities, they are quiet, slow, like our provinces. They don't have fast trains or subways. And the stores are better than, or as good as, Tokyo, but with discounted prices. Have you seen how many Armani, Missoni, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, there are in *Donne Vincenti*, across from the *Tastevin*? 

Daniel hadn't looked at the labels, to him they appeared to be the usual clothes that were taken from the display window, [worn, but never as well as on a lifeless mannequin](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#wornbut). Like a wine that's put in a [conservative bottle](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#likeawine), but also [a little gaudy](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#alittlegaudy), with its label and cork, its images and graphics, to catch a distracted eye, advertising, television. [While to him, the wine and its essence continued to speak to him with its fermentation, its desire to oxygenate, its desire to lightly settle inside the transparent glass.](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#whiletohim) 

Daniel looked at Maria. He'd never had a story, much less a story with an Asian. He looked at her eyes, her mouth, her bust like a teenager. He asked, switching to the familiar, "Why are you here? How did you come to Alba?"

"Tuscany, Veneto, and Piedmont, the lands of wine. My grandfather in Osaka said that the British wanted the wine of Piedmont, after their conflict with the French, but back then it wasn't possible. There weren't any roads or ports where it could be loaded. So the British went to Tuscany and Sicily to load their barrels. But my grandfather and my father said that it was Piedmont wine that should be taken home."

"What does you father do?" Daniel asked with a bit of weariness, looking in his pocket for a second Gauloise.

"He's the wine director at the Imperial Hotel. For him, it's important to find new wines for the management and customers. There's a lot of competition..."

"And your father sends you, Maria?" Daniel asked, biting the Gauloise that he had just lit.
