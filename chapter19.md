"Sooner or later I have to leave," said Maria.

She and Nicole were at a restaurant in Treiso. They had eaten a small [fritto misto](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#frittomisto) of brains, amaretto, sausage, artichokes and semolina, and had laughed about having that winter dish in the late spring, but they accompanied it with a bottle of young and fresh Barbera, and it made it seem more palatable. 

"Sooner rather than later. I have appointments in Tuscany and Veneto: I've stayed in Piedmont too long..." she looked Nicole in the eye and reached a hand towards hers, touching it gently. She said: "I don't think your father would let you come with me. I don't think so at all, but my invitation to Tokyo stands: whenever you want, whenever you can."

Nicole turned her hand on its back and lightly squeezed that of Maria. She said slowly, in a low voice: "I wouldn't know exactly how to tell him... I'm going with you... now. He would say no, he's afraid of what my mother's reaction would be. And then it would be unfair of me not to stay with him. Lately, we haven't seen each other much. Even if now I see him taken by this drama. Amalia and Giulio both seem crazy to me, and to you?"

Maria shrugged, continuing to caress Nicole's palm with her fingertips.

"They're very close, it's hard to judge. It's as if there were a conflict between them, perhaps they'd like to resolve it, separate from each other. But something stronger keeps them together," Maria said.

"Giulio tried, gambling the farm. Right, Maria?"

"Yes, but the result is that they're even closer," Maria answered.

"My father said that Amalia wants to recover the lost half."

"It's a solution. But how?" asked Maria.

"If you stay we'll find out," said Nicole, squeezing her hand.

Then they went down to the small piazza in Treiso, where Maria had left the car, and from where, [summit by summit](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#dicrestaincresta) the hills gently descended towards Alba. They saw [Monviso](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#monviso) in front of them and Maria said to Nicole: "Look! 'Paramount'". 

Nicole looked and responded, "It's true, it resembles it. But it's too far from Hollywood."

"One is always far from everything. Especially from those who are near," answered Maria, looking at her.

"We have to go back, now. My father will be worried."

Nicole got into the car. They descended between the vineyards of Barbaresco that were the gardens of the castle at Guarene in the distance; Monviso [rose up](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#sbalzato), ashen and solitary, dominating, against the tender blue horizon, timid, while the sun bounced around in the sky, without knowing where it should go to die.

Daniel was waiting in the dining room of the *Savona*. He was at his table. In front of him was a pitcher of cold tea and a deck of cards. 

"Did you have fun?" he asked.

"I ate, curiously, hot things. I drank a little. I'm fine, Daddy."

Daniel looked at her. She was a child. To him, she seemed to still be a child. He had to correct himself. He asked her: "Do you still want to stay here, for a few days?"
<!-- Page 135 -->

"Otherwise?" Nicole asked.

"We could go see your grandparents' house in Villefranche. Take a ride in Provence."

For a moment, Nicole had hoped her father would say 'Go with Maria,' but then laughed at the improbability of that desire and answered: "Have you finished, here? It's nice here."

Daniel looked at the cards and began dealing them on the table. "[Will they tell me that, or do I have to say it myself](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#melodovranno)?"

Nicole laughed. She said, "[You know it, Daddy. But you have to hear it from them also](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#tulosai)."

Daniel looked at her again, it was the second time, in a few minutes, that she called him Daddy. It was the second time she'd called him Daddy since he picked her up at Nice.

He began to play the cards. Out came the King of Hearts. He would have preferred the King of Diamonds. He said, "I have to settle an affair."

"Just one?" Nicole asked mischievously.

"How would you put it?" asked Daniel, embarrassed but relieved by the Queen of Spades that he had just pulled from the deck.

Nicole looked at the card and laughed.

"Affair means many things. Everyone has their own affairs. I have my affairs. You and Mom have your affairs. Amalia and Giulio have their affairs. You have your affairs."

"Do I have more of them?" Daniel asked, without looking at her.

"It would seem so," said Nicole.

Daniel looked at her and smiled. He shook his head. He said "True, and you don't always know why. It's something like the weather, perhaps. It gets cloudy. It gets sunny. There's rain. There's wind. You don't know why, and into what weather you'll pass through."

"Sometimes a glance, a caress, is enough," said Nicole.

"Also just a kiss. Just one..." said Daniel.

Nicole smiled at him, reached her hand toward the deck of cards. She took one and turned it over: it was the Queen of Hearts. She winked at him. She asked, "Can I have a Coke?"
