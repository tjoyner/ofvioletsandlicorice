"You have a guest," said Silvio, noticing Daniel and the dog coming down the stairs. Daniel looked in the room. Giulio was sitting at a table, drinking a cappuccino.

"Can you bring me a coffee, Silvio?"

Daniel sat down in front of Giulio.

"Amalia doesn't want to hear anything about returning to Ginotta, might as well sell it. But woe to anyone who makes an offer. She's made it into a cemetery."

Giulio said the sentence in one breath, as if it were still the night before and they were still within the walls of the *Tastevin*.

"Memories often need a place where they can be stored. One's head alone isn't enough," Daniel said, pouring half a bag of sugar in his coffee.

"Time has passed," Giulio said, shrugging his shoulders and finishing his drink. "Come on, let's go to Ginotta, then you can decide if you want to lose it there," he added, pointing to the dog.

"Flop. I've decided to name him Flop. When he's wagging his tail against the wall it makes a flop," said Daniel, petting the dog.

"It'll be harder to abandon, now that you've given it a name."

"I'm leaving in four days, I'll have to do it anyway."

They got up from the table and left. When they came in sight of Ginotta, the sun took in all of Madonna di Como, tinting the countryside pink, planted like a knife on the ridges of the hill.

Beyond the hazelnuts, which Daniel recognized, they crossed the vineyard, now reduced to pathetic brush, and came to the yard, where Ginotta showed all its state of disrepair: the roof sagging in the middle, windows and doors peeling, clumps of grass coming out of cracks in the walls.

"Tell me, Daniel, if you could let a farm go like that..."

"[You've also played a part...](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#youalso)"

Giulio was sitting on a wooden bench, Flop, sniffing the ground, ran back and forth, slipping on hazelnuts, and returned to the yard wagging his tail around Daniel's legs.

"Do you think I haven't tried? My sister's head is harder than a rock. We fought for years until I decided to let it go. She's my sister, she raised me, she's my family."

Daniel didn't know what to add. He remained silent in the fresh Alpine air that knew the snow of Bisalta and Monviso. A shutter suddenly slammed and Daniel stood to look at it: framed in the first floor window, facing him, was Amalia, with tousled hair, in a blue robe with small white flowers.

"I have visitors?"

"I didn't know you were coming here to sleep," answered Giulio, as if to excuse their presence.

"Have you already had coffee?" her tone had softened.

"There won't be problems with the dog, there's nothing inside that can be damaged," Giulio said, quietly, while Flop slipped into the slightly open door.

Daniel walked into a large kitchen that was a mixture of smells: flowering potatoes, apples, garlic, onion, rosemary, and cold ashes. He looked around the hearth, which was in a shadow, wide and deep with a big oak beam shelf. Cupboards and chests were stacked along the walls, while in the center a long table, with a few chairs scattered around it, was littered with dishes and cookware, as if someone had forgotten to wash up or take them away.

<!-- Page 38 -->

Suddenly Daniel felt the scent of coffee wafting from a gas stove and the gurgling of the liquid seeping into the Neopolitan roast.

Amalia came into the kitchen while Daniel turned off the gas. 

"Find two more [syringes](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#syringes)," she said, going to look for cups in the cupboard.

"[If you don't also find them stuck in an arm or a foot, count yourself lucky](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ifyoudont)..." Giulio said bitterly.

Amalia poured the coffee in silence. Looking at Flop, she said, "Maybe we should keep a dog, a guard dog..."

"[If no one poisons it for you after a few days](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#ifnoonecomes)".

Daniel went out to the yard with a cup of coffee and walked toward what was left of the vineyard. He went down the hill, soft now in the full sun, and between weeds and briars glimpsed new shoots and old rotten poles. Daniel thought it would require a lot of work to put it back on track, but that it would be worth it. The green pigment of the berries contrasted here and there with the tender colored vine leaves and the black thorn brambles: it was a chaos of vegetation that called for new geometry.

Daniel straightened up a post at the beginning of what had been a row, stripped it of brush, slowly, so as not to damage the new shoots &ndash; the stem was old but still productive &ndash; kicked dry clods with the tip of his shoe, the turned earth was loaded with humus.

He heard a light step behind him and realized it was Amalia. Without turning, he said, "Nature always recovers, it bears humiliation and indifference, but continues to express what it is."

"I didn't want to humiliate it," said Amalia with a harsh tone. "I didn't want anything from it, only this. I had already taken everything."

She paused. Daniel turned around. She was beautiful in the sunlight, her face drawn, her eyes bright. She added:  "Why do I talk to you? Why do I talk to you about these things?"

<!-- Page 39 -->

Daniel shrugged and tried to smile.

"There's no reason," he said, "except that it's often easier to talk to a stranger."

Amalia leaned against a stone bath. She ran a hand through her hair, her face had suddenly softened.

"My brother told you," she said, "that our father died in this vineyard, taken by lightning. He was coming to look for me. He thought I was in the rows, while I was in the barn playing with a stupid rag doll. It's all here."

Amalia closed her eyes and shook her head. Daniel wanted to hug her. He did not. He said, "[Don't you think that by this time your father is part of this vineyard](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#dontyouthink)?"

Amalia looked at him with pride, a look of defiance. Then she got up from the edge of the bath and walked towards the yard. She went into the kitchen, slamming the door.

Daniel continued, followed by Flop, towards the hazelnuts. When he reached the car on the road, Giulo was already there waiting for him.

"Did you have a talk?" he asked.

Daniel shrugged. Then, hitting Flop with the back of his hand, he said, "Tonight we're sleeping in the hotel again..."
<br/><br/><br/>

At the *Savona*, Daniel had gotten a phone call from Marc. He called him back. Marc told him that Nicole was better and that perhaps he'd managed to convince her to join him in Piedmont.

"When?" asked Daniel. "I'm booked until Sunday. Today is Wednesday."

"If Nicole comes you could stay longer... it would be a good opportunity to spend some time together, far from Laurencine. It might be good for all three of you."

<!-- Page 40 -->

"And when would she come?" asked Daniel apprehensively. 

"Give me a couple of days," said Marc, "I could put her on a plane here and you could pick her up in Genoa or Nice, whichever is most convenient."

"I'll ask," Daniel said. "Let me know, I'll have to get things organized."

The thought of Nicole coming to Alba troubled him. Nicole demanded constant and discreet attention. Daniel feared her sudden rages, the possibility of her escape. Could he possibly keep her with him for several days? 

It would be nice to have a short vacation with his daughter, it hadn't happened for years, not since he and Laurencine were still a family. If Amalia had a different character, perhaps he could talk to her about his problem. Or maybe he could talk to her just because she had that character. She had talked to him about certain delicate things because it was easier to tell them to a stranger.

He looked at Flop, who was crouched near the door. He wondered what he would do with Flop if Nicole came. There were too many uncertainties in his thoughts. He lay down on the bed, he needed to rest before going to breakfast.

When he came out on Via Roma he smelled an intense aroma of cocoa and vanilla that seemed to scrape his throat, so he turned towards Via Toti, as always followed by Flop. He was looking for a restaurant and was lost among the narrow streets, the low houses with balconies covered with geraniums, antique shops and hardware stores, crowded wine shops and bakeries displaying special breads of all shapes baked in wood-burning ovens. He thought he saw Amalia coming out of a shop. She wore a white dress tied at the waist by a wide blue belt. He stopped in front of the entrance, it was a hairdresser. He read the name, Egoist, smiled and ducked towards a piazza with medieval towers and tall bell towers. He saw a sign *Tavern of the Poets*: with that title, Daniel thought, they wouldn't stop dogs from entering.  He went in. The atmosphere was pleasant, with its small tables and shelves of wine on the walls, it had the appearance of a bistro. He sat and looked at the short list of daily specials. He asked for [bagna cauda](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#bagnacauda), and a plate of [vitello tonnato](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#vitellotonnato) with roasted potatoes. He ordered the house red and, to Flop, who was wedged under the chair, he gave a piece of a breadstick, coarse and uneven.

<!-- Page 41 -->
He ate with pleasure: the bread was good,  the olive oil was good, and the wine, a light Dolcetto, seemed respectable. He ended with a cup of cooked fruit and a large coffee. He gave a few more pieces of the breadstick to Flop, then asked for a bowl of water. When Flop was finished drinking, he paid and they left.

They turned a little aimlessly, towards the cathedral and town hall. Daniel bought a few postcards, then went down along Via Maestra, through tourists and school groups.

He saw a car stop on Via Maestra and heard a horn beep. It was a silver Toyota SUV, from its window a hand made a sign to hurry.  It reached Via Mandelli and the door opened. It was Amalia. "Flop can get in the back," she said, accelerating towards Via Paruzza. They left Alba and took the freeway to Turin.

"I have to get some salami and agnolotti pasta. Want to come with me?"

"You've kidnapped me," he said.

They passed through narrow villages and [countryside with enclosed industrial warehouses](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#countryside), a long row of hangars that blocked the view of the hills. Outlet, Trony, Casa della Luce, Divani & Divani: showrooms displaying tractors and Mercedes, [Magazzini del Giocattolo, Casa del Mobile da Giardino, Casa del Legno](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#magazzini), colored blue, yellow, and candy pink. Warehouses that made the streets look like one giant Lego.
