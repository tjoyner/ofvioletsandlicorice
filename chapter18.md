"[We won't get anything more from the lawyers](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#avvocati)," said Amalia from behind the bar at the *Tastevin*. Daniel had never realized that she smoked. She had a lit cigarette between her lips and the smoke was entangled in her hair. She was vigorously washing glasses and splashes of water splattered on her bare arms, leaving drops on the skin that the morning light transformed into rosy pearls.

Daniel sat at a table, not far away, with a teapot in front of him. He didn't know why he'd asked for tea, possibly because he didn't want to drink water, and it was too early to ask for a glass of white.

He looked at Amalia, her face was drawn, with fine lines crossing her cheeks and forehead. She must have had a sleepless night. 

"I did a bullshit thing last night. I know it. And it won't be the last time, if the drama continues. And therefore, in some way, it has to stop."

She looked at Daniel, she didn't have the look of someone asking for forgiveness, but said: "Or the next one will be worse. Do you have any advice?"

Amalia looked at Daniel. There was boldness in her eyes, [the request must have cost her in misguided pride](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#malinteso). But in their light there were also reflections of the softness and apprehension of a childlike gaze, frightened.

Fearing that Daniel didn't have an answer, she added "I should give up my half of Ginotta to him and not say anything more about it? Is that what I should do?"

Daniel shook his head.

"Of course not. Even in death, I'd rather leave it to the priests. Of course not. But then how do I get the other half back? Certainly not by going to lawyers or making an insanity plea for my jerk of a brother. And don't tell me to make him a monetary offer. I know that even what's in the Bank of Alba wouldn't be enough money. I could name a figure that is neither in the heaven nor in the sea, a figure that Baravalle knows very well that I don't have. And then what?"

Amalia turned to look at Daniel, and this time he saw that there was a different light in her eyes, like flashes of malice, or more: of cruelty.

"I want to recover Ginotta using the same weapons."

"How would you?" Daniel asked, feeling a chill run down his back and an intuition come into his head.

"With the only way that he can't refuse."

"How?" Daniel repeated mechanically, sure that he understood where Amalia was going.

"With gambling. Yes, we are going to play against him. We gamble my half against his."

Daniel said nothing, looked at her. He knew he was looking at her with a blank, or maybe just tired, expression. He got up from the table, went behind the bar, took a bottle of [Nonino](http://ofvioletsandlicorice.tumblr.com/post/129354078274/notes-questions-uncertainties#nonino) and poured two fingers in one glass, and two fingers in another. He tossed it down to feel the fire in his throat, he wanted to extinguish the question that he was about to ask: "Amalia, do you know how to play poker?"

He watched her take her glass and drink it in one gulp. Then he heard her voice yelling "No. No I don't know how to play!"

Daniel couldn't tell if she was laughing or crying. He had turned around to go back to sit at the table.
