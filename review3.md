Literature: Some reflections on "Of Violets and Licorice" by Nico Orengo (2005)

By Franceso Improta

An original and fascinating book for its skillful narrative construction and refined writing. It's not lacking the echoes and reminiscences of Fenoglio and Pavese, but the Langhe that Orengo talks about is completely different, just as this novel is different from his previous works. You encounter, indeed, an attention to details and nuances, a rich palate, an extraordinary nimbleness, and above all an ability to render smells and tastes that make it a unique work, highly enjoyable and not to be missed. It seems that Orengo has transformed, with a similar and at the same time opposite process from the directors of the French New Wave, the pen into a camera and approached the moral tales of Eric Rohmer, I'm thinking in particular of *Autumn Tale*.

A novel, however, that must rest (in the sense that it must re-read a few days after the first reading), like a good vintage wine, to be able to unleash all its bouquet and flavor.

*A French sommelier, Daniel, for his work, goes to Alba for a few days, and between one lesson and the other of his wine-tasting course on the great wines of France, given at a local wine-bar, visits places, crosses landscapes, but above all encounters men and women, who fully illustrate the great land that is the Langhe, "the vinous heart of Piedmont," as Mario Soldati rightly said, revealing that surly character, introverted but candid, of the people of this land, who will be of such influence on the life of the protagonist.*

Granted that "Of Violets and Licorice" has the brilliance and lightness of a rare pearl, I would like to make two observations.

The first regards the underlying tone which, in my opinion, is predominantly melancholy, nostalgic. Nico in fact describes a world is vanishing or had already disappeared: the Langhe of Fenoglio, Pavese, and Arpino, the Langhe of the ruins, of the bonfire, of the partisan resistance. The story takes place in the present day, speaking, then, about the present, but the gaze of Nico is turned constantly to the past. And this tone becomes darker when Eta Beta, in the journey from Alba to Nice, tells of a love, a love like a Gozzano memory, a love not for what it was, but for what it could have been. A love, we could say, of unpicked roses.

The second observation is more technical and regards Nico's style of writing, decidedly cinematic, he seems to have used the pen as a camera. I'm thinking of the way in which Amalia enters a scene, with movement discovered by the camera, from the particular to the whole. Not surprisingly, Nico first describes her hand laying on the table, where Daniel is sitting, then a glass, and then the camera pans and Amalia appears in all her charm and beauty. Also, on the way back from Nice to Alba, Nico, focusing exclusively on the second car, which contains Eta Beta, Maria and Amalia's brother, he describes not what Daniel and his daughter, who are traveling in the second car, really say or do, but what appears to the eyes of their followers. And not to forget, reflecting the interest and love of Nico for film, the reference to the Paramount logo that comes naturally to Maria when she sees the summit of Monviso, or the comparison the author uses to say that there was a missed odor: "...a black rip plunged into his nostrils, like on a movie screen when the film breaks." This last quote confirms what I stated previously about the underlying tone of the novel being nostalgic and melancholy: Nico watches with a fond yearning and a hint of regret for the world of this youth, one of discoveries and adventures, when, in fact, the film is often jumpy or burning. As dated as the songs of Dean Martin and the village carousels.
